In the last couple of years the field witnessed a phenomenal scale of deployment; Google is known to run clusters with thousands of machines each, Apple deploys over 100,000 database machines, and Netflix runs tens of database clusters with 500 nodes each.  This new era of cloud-scale distributed systems has given birth to a new class of faults, scalability faults---faults whose symptoms surface in large-scale deployments but not necessarily in small/medium-scale deployments.  The CP2 project is proposed to solve the problem of correctness checkability and performance predictability of systems at extreme scale.  Specifically the project will analyze over 500 real-world scalability faults in over a dozen large-scale systems, develop a single-machine scale-checking framework that allows developers to test large distributed code on one or a few machines, and provide groundwork for compute- and I/O-performance predictability of large-scale jobs on both existing and future architectures.  These tasks will advance debugging, testing, learning, and prediction methods both on traditional hardware platforms and emerging ones and ultimately lead to correct-by-construction development methods. The CP2 project will have impact in multiple disciplines including systems (cloud/datacenter systems reliability), programming languages/compilers (new static/dynamic analysis techniques), architecture (compute/storage prediction for heterogeneous hardware), algorithms (the use of learning methods), and high-performance computing (benchmarking of HPC systems/applications).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of societal benefits, the CP2 project addresses paramount issues mentioned in the NSF Strategic Plan for 2018-2022.  More specifically, society increasingly depends on complicated systems that are products of human ingenuity, including ecosystems of large and complex software with millions of lines of code running on thousands of machines.  CP2 will address the challenges of understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems.  Furthermore, as society\\u2019s reliance on complex systems grows, learning about their robustness and understanding how to strengthen them are of increasing importance.  In terms of education, the CP2 project gives unique hands-on research and education with cutting-edge systems technology in which students will be trained to operate software on a large number of machines and analyze their performance and correctness.  The results of the CP2 project will be released through the classic medium of publication, through the development of numerous software artifacts which will be open-sourced, and finally through collaboration with various industry partners to help shape the next generation of large-scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.958916664123535, \"y\": 9.67886734008789}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"A Family of Diagnostic Models for Evaluating Learning Progressions\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This research project will develop psychometric methodology to empirically evaluate developmental progressions.  A developmental progression describes a theorized or observed sequence of cognitive, psychological, or behavioral developments in an individual or group. In educational settings, learning progressions describe the increasingly sophisticated ways of reasoning that develop as students learn about specific content domains over time. Despite their prevalence and utility, quantitative methodological developments to evaluate learning progressions have stagnated. This project will advance the fields of psychometrics and learning sciences by providing a modern, multidimensional, and longitudinal framework for modeling developmental progressions. Although the project focuses on educational applications, the developed methods will be widely applicable in disciplines across the social and behavioral sciences. The project will train a graduate student from an underrepresented group. Free and easy-to-use software will be developed for researchers to utilize in their own examinations of learning progressions. The results and products stemming from this project have the potential to change the way researchers design, interpret, and analyze assessments in the empirical evaluation of developmental progressions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will use a diagnostic classification model (DCM) framework to model learning progressions. DCMs are multivariate psychometric models that classify examinees into specified levels of categorical latent traits (e.g., basic, proficient, advanced). DCMs have become attractive in educational settings because they provide much desired diagnostic and criterion-referenced score interpretations in the form of classifications. Recently, DCMs have been developed for longitudinal contexts that provide criterion-referenced interpretations of student growth. To model learning progressions, the developed model will combine a generalized longitudinal DCM with the hierarchical DCM designed to model attribute hierarchies. This fusion of modeling frameworks allows for the simultaneous examination of attribute hierarchies and student learning over time, which together comprise the basis of a learning progression. Simulation studies will guide and inform the practical application of the developed methods with respect to data requirements (i.e., number of items or sample size), test design, model fit, and factors impacting the accuracy, validity, and reliability of model-based inferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 2.6538259983062744, \"y\": 8.021191596984863}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: An Integrated Experimental-Theoretical Framework for Understanding the Multiscale Mechanical Response of Rock-Reactive Brine Interactions\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program will support research to understand and elucidate the evolution of the mechanical properties of rocks when interacting with reactive brine. The interaction between rocks and reactive brine in harsh environments plays an important role in several applications, such as stability of slopes and abandoned underground caves, carbon sequestration, enhanced geothermal systems, reservoir stimulation, and contaminant transport. By understanding how rock-reactive brine interaction affects the mechanical properties of rocks, it will be possible to develop more realistic physical-chemical models that are critical for predicting rock mechanical stability and for quantitatively interpreting geophysical monitoring data. However, the challenge comes from the complex multiscale and heterogeneous nature of rocks and the complexity of rock-reactive brine interactions, making the traditional experimental and modeling techniques ineffective for this problem. This project uses novel multiscale experiments and theory to reveal the origins of how mechanical properties of rocks change when exposed to reactive brine. The outcomes of this project will serve the society by enhancing infrastructure system resiliency, and energy and resource efficiency. This project also has a comprehensive education and outreach plan to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM and enhance education in chemistry and mechanics of rock and fluid interaction. This is done through engaging traditionally underrepresented high school students, increasing the general public\\u2019s understanding of the impact of rock and fluid interaction, and educating graduate and undergraduate students in collaborative and interdisciplinary research activities. The main activity is recruiting underrepresented undergraduates and engaging high school students via an extended outreach program entitled \\u201cRocks and Fluids.\\u201d &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this CAREER program are to (1) Understand the effect of chemo-mechanical rock-reactive brine interaction on the microstructural/morphological texture and compositional properties of rocks; (2) Determine the relationship between chemo-mechanical loading and geomechanical response at multiple scales; and (3) Determine the stress/strain distribution within the rock as a function of its time-evolving microstructure, induced by chemical and mechanical effects, using a physical-chemical pore-scale model. The research approaches include micro-scale chemo-mechanical characterization of individual rock constituents, macro-scale mechanical assessment, and microstructural characterization of rock samples before and after exposure to reactive brine at high temperature and pressure conditions; and development of a pore-scale model to gain insight into time-dependent mechanical and deformational behavior of rocks influenced by chemo-mechanical interactions.

This event is accompanied by an abrupt 5 to 9 degrees Celsius (9 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit) global temperature rise along with indications of large quantities of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This project will refine the stratigraphic record of this event as preserved in deposits of the ancient Tethys sea for proxy records of temperature change during this interval in this region. The research will use nannofossil biochronology and high-resolution magnetic susceptibility to begin to unravel the geological history of the region and examine the potential to use a state-of-the art geochemical paleothermometer to quantify temperature change.  In doing so, the research will evaluate the importance of the Tethys sea in global climate patterns as well as the role of rapid changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide in this much warmer climate state. The project will also provide support for undergraduate students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Students will be recruited from the American Chemical Society\\u2019s project SEED (Summer Experiences for the Economically Disadvantaged) and GS-LSAMP (the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation).  The results of the research will be presented in public events and the data made available to the broader paleoclimate community through the NOAA Paleoclimate database and MagIC database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research goals of this project are to (1) further develop the stratigraphic record of the pace and timing of temperature increase in the eastern Tethys sea during the PETM , (2) use rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy to estimate the sedimentation rate, and (3) evaluate the feasibility of applying the distributions of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers to reconstruct sea surface temperatures. These data will evaluate the potential importance of the eastern Tethys in regulating global temperature and moisture changes, as well as the role of large and rapid changes in atmospheric CO2 forcing during the PETM. This information could help document a paleoclimate record that will transform our understanding of the drivers of the PETM and offer useful insight into how the Earth system will respond to current increases in atmospheric CO2 and more generally provide insight into key parameters in global climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.697635173797607, \"y\": 5.722927093505859}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"I-Corps Teams: IoT Sensor Networks Detecting User Behavior in Architectural Space\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a cost-effective solution to detect user behavior in architectural space without violating the user\\u2019s privacy.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) requires extensive high-throughput computing infrastructure and a skilled workforce, to develop innovative approaches in computing and data science, to manage and exploit the large and complex datasets produced by its radio telescopes. In-depth academic research has investigated the causes of the persistent under-representation of minorities in the US STEM sector. The needs of the NRAO, and the findings of the research, inspired initial meetings between the NRAO and minority-serving institutions (MSIs). At these meetings, it was agreed that both astronomy and diversity could benefit from a network of multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary partners, to commit complementary expertise and resources. The Radial Alliance, consisting of ten MSIs and NRAO, will seek to provide these ten MSIs with high-throughput computing processing infrastructure and support; data sets from the NRAO\\u2019s Very Large Array Sky Survey; and an open access, interactive undergraduate and graduate curriculum, to train under-represented minority students in astronomy, computing and data science. This innovative approach will be supported by a \\u201ccradle to career\\u201d development program, including an interactive K-12 curriculum for schools surrounding the MSIs; undergraduate research experiences and a mentorship program for students; a professional development program for students, educators and faculty; affirmative spaces on the MSI campuses; and an outreach program targeted at students\\u2019 families and communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this planning grant is to complete initiation and planning phases for the Radial Alliance.

The subject matter lies at the intersection of geometric measure theory, partial differential equations, and harmonic analysis. In geometric measure theory, one studies geometric properties of sets via the behavior of some measure on that set, where the concept of \\\"measure\\\" generalizes the notions of length, area and volume. In this project, the kind of set that we consider is typically the boundary of some region in space, or of some evolving region in space-time.  Partial differential equations describe mathematically the conduction of heat, the propagation of waves, and many other physical phenomena. Harmonic analysis is a mathematical tool with which one extracts information by decomposing mathematical functions into fundamental constituent pieces. A principal goal of this project is to understand, in a quantitative way, how the geometry of a region influences the conduction of heat through the region, and across its boundary. This project will contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three main areas of focus: 1) the Neumann Problem. The PI plans to solve the Neumann problem for Laplace's equation, with p-integrable data, in domains satisfying a quantitative, scale invariant version of a measure theoretic condition which is equivalent to the existence of a measure-theoretic outer unit normal at almost every boundary point; thus, the condition is natural for the Neumann problem, and may be sharp. Eventually, the PI seeks to characterize geometrically the domains in which such solvability is possible. 2) Parabolic quantitative rectifiability. At present, the theory of quantitative rectifiability in the time-evolutive parabolic setting is quite rudimentary in comparison to the rich theory available in the steady-state elliptic setting.  In recent work of the PI and co-authors, elliptic quantitative rectifiability has played a central role in the characterization of those domains for which the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation is solvable. The PI expects that the proposed work would be a first step towards an analogous characterization in the parabolic case. 3) The Kato square root problem for non-divergence form elliptic operators.  The solution of the square root problem for divergence form elliptic operators has enabled significant progress in the theory of boundary value problems for divergence form equations.  As a first step towards opening up the analogous theory in the non-divergence setting, the PI proposes to treat the Kato problem for non-divergence elliptic operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.1386399269104, \"y\": 9.33356761932373}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Winds and the Weather: Evaluating Three Dimensional (3D) Stratospheric / Tropospheric Jet Relationships and Their Roles in Extreme Cool-Season Weather Events\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The stratosphere is a layer of the atmosphere where the increase of temperature with height discourages vertical motions, thereby barring entry to the clouds, storms, and frontal weather systems that form in the troposphere below. Nevertheless very long waves can propagate from the troposphere into the stratosphere and influence its circulation, most dramatically by disrupting its circumpolar vortex and causing a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event.  Conversely, the stratospheric circulation can have a substantial effect on tropospheric weather, albeit through indirect pathways which are not entirely understood.  In particular several studies have shown that cold air outbreaks (CAOs) are more likely when the stratospheric circumpolar vortex is weak, or disrupted by an SSW, and the condition of the stratospheric vortex can also influence the tropospheric jet streams in ways that can in turn affect surface weather.  Interactions between the stratosphere and troposphere are thus of practical as well as scientific importance and are a focus of substantial research effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research under this award uses novel methods to characterize the three-dimensional structure of stratosphere-troposphere interactions.  The work complements previous studies which have emphasized spatially aggregated quantities like the mean strength of the stratospheric vortex averaged over the polar cap and the mean speed of tropospheric jets averaged around circles of latitude.  A hemispheric average can suffice to identify an SSW but it may conceal differences in the structure of the event which matter for its interactions with the troposphere.  For instance the stratospheric vortex can be weaker in a hemispherically-averaged sense because the vortex center has moved away from the pole, or because the vortex has in fact split into two distinct vortices. A split vortex and a displaced vortex are likely to influence the troposphere in different ways. Their influence on jet streams may also depend on longitudinal variations in jet speed that would be obscured by averaging around a latitude circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work consists primarily of analysis of stratosphere-troposphere interactions identified in two datasets developed by the Principal Investigators.  One is called JETPAC, for JEt and Tropopause Products for Analysis and Characterization, which identifies the locations of jet stream maxima on a three-dimensional grid including the troposphere and lower stratosphere and also identifies the tropopause (or multiple tropopauses) in each grid column.  The second is developed using an algorithm called CAVE-ART, for Characterization and Analysis of Vortex Evolution using Algorithms for Region Tracking.  CAVE-ART uses methods from computer vision to identify the three-dimensional structure of the stratospheric polar vortex. CAVE-ART is able to track separate pieces of the vortex in the event of a splitting SSW event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impact due its relevance to significant weather events such as CAOs.

Research has shown that negative emotional reactions can impair employees\\u2019 task performance and result in counterproductive work behavior and, in severe cases, insider threat behavior. Much of this research has been guided by theories predicting causal event-emotion-behavior sequences. However, the many empirical studies in this area are either correlational rather than causal (e.g., ecological momentary assessment studies) or conducted in the laboratory rather than in situ. This research will help employees gain strategies to regulate their emotions, thereby potentially improving task performance and deterring counterproductive and insider threat behavior. Thus, the research has the potential to improve employee well-being. The research also has the potential to aid organizations in weakening the links between stressful events and insider threat behavior on the part of their employees. Finally, this research will illustrate the JITAI as a new and very different type of intervention that can fruitfully augment traditional interventions in a variety of topic areas within the organizational sciences (e.g., occupational safety interventions, sexual harassment prevention interventions, leader development interventions, and technical skills training interventions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current pair of studies will manipulate emotional experience via randomly assigned Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), also known as ecological momentary interventions. Tailored interventions are needed to help individuals regulate negative emotions in the moment\\u2014when most needed and before the resulting deleterious performance outcomes manifest. As such, the JITAIs in the current research are focused on emotion regulation, thereby providing causal tests of the role of emotion on behavior as well as testing additional research questions involving situational and dispositional moderators of emotion-behavior relationships. Unlike standard interventions, these JITAIs are within-person interventions that capitalize on temporal states of vulnerability (e.g., high levels of negative emotion) and aspects of the current context (e.g., the nature of the emotion-causing episode, the feasibility of completing the intervention at that particular moment) to optimize treatment effectiveness. Specifically, in the proposed studies, participants will repeatedly be randomly (re-)assigned to different cognitively-focused emotion reappraisal interventions or to no intervention (control condition) over the course of several work weeks. The reappraisal strategies to be contrasted against each other (and against a control condition) include imagining that a negative emotional stimulus or situation had a positive outcome, altering the impact of the emotional stimulus by adopting a more-or-less objective perspective, and interpreting the focal emotion in a manner that facilitates an accepting, observing, non-judgmental relationship to emotions. The first study is a micro-randomized trial that will provide for causal inferences regarding emotion and the effects of three cognitive reappraisal JITAIs in achieving proximal (i.e., decision-point and day level) emotion and performance outcomes. The results from the first study will permit the optimization of decision rules (e.g., dropping a less effective intervention, including decision rules for which intervention should be used when based on context) to inform the second study.

Caroline Stromberg and Mark D. Schmitz, respectively. Understanding the Earth system under climates warmer than today is a useful approach for understanding the consequences of future warming resulting from human-caused climate change. One such warm period in the Earth\\u2019s history is the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), approximately 17-14 million years ago, when global temperatures were 4-7\\u00b0C warmer than the modern, pre-industrial period. Fossil plant assemblages from the MMCO have been used to understand how the climate and ecosystems of that time functioned on long (millions of years) timescales. However, the importance of climate and ecosystem processes that function on shorter (hundreds of thousands of years and shorter) timescales has not often been considered. New research has suggested that climate change on short timescales and large, frequent volcanic eruptions may have greatly affected MMCO ecosystems. Therefore, it becomes unclear if ecosystem changes seen in fossil plant assemblages are representative of long-term climate conditions or a response to short-term processes. This study of MMCO vegetation in the Pacific Northwest aims to understand the cause of ecosystem change seen in fossil plants.

How these organisms produce and use their biological adhesives is the key to understanding how they function mechanically and how they have evolved. An extraordinary glue -- with an unusual combination of water-like fluidity when applied and rubbery toughness when set -- is produced by a small group of spiders. This glue is predicted to be critical to how these spiders catch flying moths, which few other spiders can do.

Bioadhesives, such as the glues produced by spiders, are excellent systems for this type of investigation because their mechanical behavior is directly observable in the organism's ecological context. For most orb-weaving spiders, one type of abundant prey is elusive: moths. But moths are captured by cyrtarachnine spiders. They use a capture glue that possesses low viscosity and when in contact with moths has the highest adhesive strength and toughness among spider glues measured among spider glues. This project tests the hypothesis that this capture glue is the key adaptation of the Cyrtarachninae for catching moths. The glue\\u2019s rate and extent of spreading will be measured with high-speed micro-videography to test competing microfluidic models. Adhesive behavior of the glue, the second step in the capture process, quantified as adhesive strength (N) and adhesive toughness (Nm-2), will be measured in the field and in the lab using pull-off tension tests. Genes for the glue proteins will be identified using a combination of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches. Finally, genomic and mechanical traits will be mapped onto the phylogeny of the Cyrtarachninae and the states of the hypothetical common ancestor reconstructed.

A central challenge in the development of new electrolytes for batteries is poor understanding of the electrolyte degradation pathways that lead to battery failure. This CAREER project will develop computational methods to comprehensively elucidate these electrolyte reactions. Success in this project will transform how electrolytes are designed and implemented using a computational approach before costly synthesis and testing. The resulting new knowledge about electrolyte degradation chemistry and new simulation methodologies will benefit the next generation of scientists and engineers working on batteries.

The proposed methods will leverage a novel combination of two recent breakthroughs, making this an ideal time to investigate electrolyte degradation problem from a computational perspective. First, we will use modern semi-empirical quantum chemistry to provide the simulation throughout required to comprehensively describe the complex reaction networks associated with electrolyte degradation. Second, we will apply transfer learning models to improve the accuracy of describing reactions in condensed phases and at electrode interfaces. In combination, these strategies will address the tradeoff between computational accuracy and cost that has limited the application of reaction network characterizations to liquid electrolytes. These simulation methodologies will initially be applied to liquid electrolyte formulations that have widespread usage in contemporary Li-ion and post Li-ion batteries. Despite the fact that these are established electrolytes, the degradation chemistry that drives solid-electrolyte interphase formation and electrolyte-related failure is still incompletely resolved. Thus, by focusing on these electrolyte chemistries, we will be able to validate our characterization methodology while also providing the first complete view of the degradation reactions that occur in these electrolytes. The reaction data generated by these characterizations will also be used to create reaction databases that will facilitate machine learning activities aimed at prioritizing or even circumventing more costly physics-based simulations of electrolytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.735179901123047, \"y\": 7.679914474487305}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: Advancing Online Social Support for Older Adults with Disabilities\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The field of human-computer interaction has yet to address the complexities of designing online social technologies for older adults with severe late-life disability, a challenging problem that will grow in importance and scale with future generations.  Social computing has changed how people communicate to such a degree that exclusion from online experiences can mean exclusion from critical aspects of society, and older adults are particularly vulnerable to such exclusion.  While many people age without significant disability, one in four Americans who are 65 and older has a severe disability.  Contact with one's social support network becomes increasingly important as health declines, whereas late-life health conditions and associated disability make staying connected difficult.  A promising solution to this emerging problem is the PI's concept of \\\"hybrid social computing\\\" in which familiar communication interfaces are integrated with online social platforms while harnessing support networks to enable and protect users online.  In this project the PI will focus on two pervasive conditions among older adults: late-life vision impairments and late-life speech-language impairments.  She will utilize field research methods to understand the needs and challenges around online interaction for the two populations of study.  She will then refine and extend three innovative prototypes developed in preliminary work, and rigorously evaluate the effects of these new tools through usability and field studies.  Without online tools for older adults with severe late-life disabilities, we are unable to study the effects of online interaction for those who may benefit most, and the benefits may be vast.  Staying socially connected can affect late-life physical and mental health, and staying connected online is associated with lower rates of depression and loneliness among older adults.  With evidence of how the developed systems support online interaction, the results will impact strategies to promote late-life social connectedness and well-being.  The integrated education and outreach plan fosters experiential learning with local community impact, including a mentorship program that enriches an accompanying undergraduate curriculum while drawing community members with disabilities into university activities.  The PI will release the developed software as open source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop a conceptual and technical framework for enabling and studying online social support for older adults with severe late-life disabilities.  Extending an active program of research, this work will contribute: a conceptual and technical framework for connecting familiar communication interfaces with dynamic online systems while enabling and protecting users; new knowledge of the needs and challenges around online interaction in the context of late-life disability, providing the foundation for the proposed framework through design guidelines and a taxonomy; three innovative hybrid social computing applications, which will further refine this framework and introduce new techniques for accessible online interaction; and empirical and theoretical understandings of online communication for two understudied populations, including evidence of how online interaction affects social well-being.  The integrated education plan involves developing a community-based mentorship program, which will extend a new undergraduate curriculum on design, computing, and disability.  The proposed framework is potentially transformative in that it enables new forms of online interaction, making it possible to examine phenomena of online behavior with entirely new demographics.

Such accidents result from three interrelated factors: the boat operator, the vessel, and the environment. This mobile app uses crowdsourcing data (directly from recreational boat operators) to provide boat operators with enhanced situational awareness when on the water; e.g., access to high resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) charts, social connectivity, integrated tide/current data, automated float plan/tracking monitored by trusted friends or relatives, rapid access to emergency services, etc. The commercial pathway of this app is focused on providing the basic mobile app and related safety tools to the recreational boating public for free but offering more advanced (customer requested) features such as social connectivity and group tracking for an additional fee.  A second commercial pathway for this application is focused on (de-identified) data gathering of recreational boater on-the-water patterns and behavior.  These data have particular significance within the marine insurance industry for actuarial reasons and also have commercial potential within the commercial boating industry as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of current, sustainable, comprehensive, authoritative, non-accident based recreational boater data that is critical to the geospatial analytics needed to refine and better understand the nature and causality of recreational boat accidents.  The proposed mobile app is based on a formula where the space-time array of accidents relates to a space-time function of human, technological, and environmental factors. The primary technical hurdle is to develop a mobile app in a way that will be adopted broadly by recreational boaters and will thus facilitate the effective collection of real-time, crowdsourced data. This mobile app is intended to bridge the data gap between the scarcity of data currently available and the boating accident formula and in so doing more closely address the challenge of state and federal boating regulatory agencies; i.e., to reduce recreational boating accidents and fatalities. To accomplish this, a more optimal means of recreational boating data collection is required to better understand the underlying nature of accident causality.

When water is disinfected with chlorine, halogenation reactions occur. Such reactions can decrease levels of harmful chemical pollutants in water. Halogenation reactions can also generate toxic chlorinated byproduct from natural or man-made precursors in water. This project seeks to understand the rates and mechanisms of these reactions. The focus is  on parabens, which are used as preservatives in shampoos, lotions, and other consumer products. Parabens can be washed down the drains of showers and sinks as components of greywater. When greywater is recycled, parabens can enter drinking water. Parabens resemble molecules that are naturally present in lakes and rivers due to the breakdown of plant matter. Therefore, studying how parabens respond to the chlorination process associated with drinking water treatment can lead to insights into chlorination reactions with other molecules. The research is conducted as a collaboration between a large research university (USC) and a primarily undergraduate institution (TU). The project also includes a teaching internship for a USC graduate student at TU, and a summer research internship for a TU undergraduate at USC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team studies fundamental aspects of aqueous halogenation important for understanding the fate of parabens and other aromatic nucleophiles. Specific questions addressed by this project include: (1) What is the role of trace, highly reactive, often-overlooked halogenating species (such as Cl2O and BrCl) in the halogenation of parabens? (2) During chloramination, when ammonia-containing water is chlorinated, what is the role of individual chloramine species? Is monochloramine, which dominates chloramine speciation, essentially inert? (3) What fraction of active halogen consumption results in halogenation versus oxidation and formation of inert inorganic halide species?

Naturally, it is desirable to deploy these technologies in IoT infrastructures. However, such deployments present daunting changes for increasingly scaled-up IoT infrastructures in mission-critical applications such as medical, energy, transportation, and industrial-automation systems. These challenges stem from several major aspects in terms of scalability. First, the number of edge devices can be enormous, often in the order of billions, which makes centralized management infeasible. Second, there are multiple layers of heterogeneity. An IoT system can consist of heterogeneous computing subsystems; each subsystem can have heterogeneous computing devices; and each single device can be composed of different kinds of computing components. Third, mission-critical applications have stringent requirements in correctness, resilience, timeliness, security and safety.

The data has to be transmitted over wireless channels with tight latency and security guarantees, and coupled with real-time analysis to allow precise trouble-shooting, coordination, and monitoring. The inescapable conclusion is that to enable smart manufacturing, a tight integration \\u2013 and, in fact, cross-layer optimization \\u2013 of manufacturing technologies, robotics and control, networking protocols such as 5G, and machine learning paradigms such as inference on the edge is needed. Achieving this vision is the goal of the institute envisaged in this planning grant.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Realizing an effective institute will require experts in advanced manufacturing, AI, sensing, computation, and sensing, as well as collaboration with industry and federal research labs.

This project focuses on understanding the engaging and disengaging mechanisms of anisotropic fibrillar adhesive units featuring a variety of contact shapes/geometries and structural/materials gradient across multiple lengths and temporal scales. The proposed dry adhesive design incorporates both the geometrical anisotropy seen at the setal level and the special contact shape of the setal branches at the spatula level. The ultimate goal is to elucidate how adhesion and friction are coupled and may be better controlled by rationally designing the geometry dependent dry adhesive units. Adhesive performance will be evaluated under cyclic loadings and non-dust-free environments, as well as different temperatures and relative humidity, using a custom-designed surface force apparatus. Multiscale anisotropic finite-element cohesive-zone modeling will be implemented to parameterize the contact shape dependent interfacial behaviors, and to analyze the adhesive mechanisms, fracture and failures.

The core plays a central role in the planet\\u2019s geomagnetism, dynamic processes, and thermal evolution. Here, the team conducts laboratory experiments at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in Earth\\u2019s deep interior.  They measure the properties of the iron-rich materials that make up the core, e.g., their deformation mechanisms and viscosity.  These properties can be dramatically altered at core conditions. The results give insight into why seismic waves travel at different speeds through different parts of the inner core. They constrain how the Earth\\u2019s magnetic field is generated and unveil its past evolution. These outcomes are valuable to many researchers studying deep Earth\\u2019s processes: mineral physicists, seismologists, and geodynamicists. The project promotes technical advances useful across disciplines, in geoscience and materials science, and in the industry. It also provides support for a female graduate student, training for undergraduate students, and outreach toward K-12 students and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims at characterizing key rheological properties of iron and iron-rich compounds and alloys at the extreme conditions of the deep Earth. Two fundamental questions are addressed: (1) What causes inner-core seismic anisotropy? (2) How does viscous dissipation in the outer core influence the evolution of the geodynamo? To address the first question, the team characterizes the dominant deformation mechanisms and strength of solid iron at high pressures and temperatures. The lattice preferred orientation that develops during iron crystallization is also measured. The goal is to understand how the alignment of elastically anisotropic iron crystals may be acquired during solidification or subsequent deformation (or both).  To this aim, the researchers carry out static compression experiments in resistive and laser-heated diamond anvil cells. They perform in situ X-ray imaging and diffraction measurements at national synchrotron facilities.  Addressing the second question requires measuring iron viscosity at core conditions. While traditional measurements are limited to lower pressures, the team benefit from new technical developments; these enable a path toward measuring the viscosity of iron dynamically compressed to outer core conditions. Thus the team carries out dynamic compression experiments and use novel X-ray diffraction and imaging techniques at the Materials at Extreme Conditions instrument at the Linac Coherent Light Source (SLAC) and the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. These experiments represent new opportunities to leverage the considerable resources and expertise available at national laboratories and apply them to better understand the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.895910263061523, \"y\": 6.702805995941162}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"MRI: Acquisition of a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)Spectrometer to Enable Material Science Research\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs.

The principal investigator will study a certain class of dynamical systems where the ambient space is locally three dimensional. In particular, the project will study what are called partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. The importance of these systems is that they satisfy strong stability conditions: nearby systems are also partially hyperbolic, and they are the only ones in dimension three satisfying these properties. The project will analyze the structure of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in dimension three, an area that is currently extremely active. The project will also involve the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms (in dimension three) are bijective smooth maps that admit invariant contracting and expanding directions, and another invariant direction that is in between, called the center direction.

One of the key tasks that robots will need to do when talking with everyday people is referring expression generation, which is the process of creating descriptions like \\\"the office at the end of the hallway.\\\" When robots generate such descriptions, they need to do so in a way that is accurate (the description shouldn't be wrong), natural (the description shouldn't sound awkward), understandable (the listener should be able to interpret the description quickly and effortlessly), and efficient (the robot should be able to generate the description without having to pause and think for too long). To understand how robots might generate descriptions in a way that satisfies these properties, we can start by trying to understand how people do so. One reason we are good at generating referring expressions may be because of our working, or short term, memory, which we use to keep a small amount of timely and important information available in a way that we can quickly and effortlessly access. The key idea of this project is to give robots the same type of working memory capabilities, and the same ways of thinking about what might be in peoples' working memories, so they will be able to use that timely and important information to do a better job at generating referring expressions.

By addressing these hypotheses, the research will develop: (1) the first algorithms for referring expression generation in robot cognitive architectures that are informed by current psychological theories of human working memory; (2) a fundamental new understanding of how robots can intelligently manage and allocate resources within artificial working memory models, (3) an understanding of which memory models will produce optimal performance from both robotics and cognitive modeling perspectives; (4) fundamental new understanding of how the goal relevance of entities and their properties can be automatically assessed within integrated cognitive architectures; (5) understanding of how goal relevance can be used to allocate cognitive resources within robotic models of working memory; (6) understanding of which goal-driven resource allocation strategies will produce optimal performance from both robotics and cognitive modeling perspectives; and (7) freely-available datasets of human-robot dialogues, and a freely-available experimental framework to allow other researchers to collect additional such dialogues, both of which will be permanently archived via the Open Science Framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.5380406379699707, \"y\": 8.308549880981445}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CCRI: Planning: Collaborative Research: A Platform for Conducting Software Engineering User Studies\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"A key goal of software engineering and programming languages research is to create new environments, tools, languages, and techniques through which software engineers create software.

Metallic and intermetallic bonding of the alkaline-earth metals is a subject of both conceptual and practical importance. The bonds formed by alkaline earth metals show erratic trends, with the most unpredictable behavior exhibited by molecules that contain the element beryllium (Be). The chemistry of Be is under-explored owing to its toxicity, but its compounds exhibit unique and valuable properties. For example, beryllium alloys are used as lightweight structural materials due to their exceptional strength to weight ratios. The remarkable durability of the metal is reflected by the fact that it is used as a plasma-facing material in extremely high-temperature fusion reactors. A common type of chemical bond is called a covalent single bond, where two electrons are shared by two atoms, each atom of the pair typically contributing one electron to the bond. Beryllium atoms are unusual in that they often form what are called dative covalent bonds, where both bonding electrons are provided by the other atom. Professor Heaven and his research group use specialized instrumentation to characterize the structure and properties of small molecules containing alkaline earth metals, including bonds with another type of atom called alkali metals. This research project provides new insights into chemical bonding in general, including data that can be used to test new theories to describe bonding and to help in the prediction of the properties of novel compounds for technological applications. The molecules under examination include diatomics that have been proposed as the basic units (called qubits) for quantum information storage and quantum computing.  The graduate students engaged in this project receive advanced training in both experimental and theoretical chemistry. Undergraduate students from institutions in the Atlanta University Center Consortium (AUCC) are also involved in the project, providing research opportunities for undergraduate students from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Undergraduate researchers receive technical training related to the investigation of bonding mechanisms, and also develop important career skills, such as networking, manuscript preparation, and oral presentation of research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present, the experimental data needed to evaluate high-level quantum chemical models for compounds containing beryllium and the heavier alkaline earth metals are lacking. This validation is necessary to establish confidence in the computational methods that are used to identify compounds with valuable physical and chemical properties. Experimental studies of prototypical compounds are the primary objectives of this research. Spectroscopic techniques, including laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and pulsed-field ionization-zero electron kinetic energy (PFI-ZEKE) measurements, are being applied to gas-phase molecules and ions to obtain structural and thermodynamic properties. The species being examined include LiBeLi, which is predicted to have a 3-center 4-electron bond, Li4Be2, where the Be2 sub-unit is thought to have two sigma-bonds with no pi-bonding contribution, and Li6Be2 where quantum calculations predict an unprecedented Be-Be triple bond. In addition to the experimental spectroscopic work, this project employs computational studies that utilize complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods.

Wave phenomena become more complicated to model as the frequency of the wave increases, and our current ability to accurately model high-frequency waves is quite limited.

Recently, one of the investigators developed a new class of solvers for the variable coefficient Helmholtz equation that achieve extremely high accuracy and have run times that scale much more slowly with increasing frequency than conventional solvers. They operate by solving the nonlinear Riccati equation that is satisfied by the logarithms of solutions of the Helmholtz equation. Currently, these solvers only apply in special cases.

Progress in mathematics education can be facilitated by identification and removal of factors that impede math engagement and learning. One such factor is anxiety about mathematics. Math anxiety predicts avoidance of math and poor math achievement, and disproportionately affects individuals with math learning disabilities, women, minorities, and those from lower socio- economic backgrounds. Although substantial work has demonstrated the various correlates and deleterious effects of math anxiety, there is much less direct evidence about what causes it. The main goal of this research is to explore one potential cause of math anxiety that has received relatively little research attention: time-pressure. Time-pressure is a major aspect of math instruction and assessment, from elementary classrooms to university lecture halls. This research project, conducted by researchers from Georgetown University, will address three primary questions: (1) Does time-pressure in math settings cause math anxiety in-the-moment and, if so, are there physiological markers that identify on whom it has the greatest impact? (2) Does time-pressure have long-term implications for math learning, future resilience to time pressure, and math anxiety? (3) Does exposure to time-pressure in math settings have differential implications, whether positive or negative, depending on when in development that exposure occurred?

They will use behavioral as well as physiological measures of anxiety such as cardiac activity.

By separating high-level task planning from low-level robot control using a physical scene representation, the system allows the operator to specify task goals without having expert knowledge of the robot hardware and configuration.

However, the limited methods to control growth and rationally modify the resultant structures of these materials represents a significant impediment to progress in this field. Peptides and proteins are attractive candidates for the construction of these types of 2D materials since the control of sequence potentially permits the control of structure and function across length scales. One complicating factor is that proteins commonly display complex folding pathways, which can often result in limited control over the structure of the final material. An approach is proposed in which structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a vast library of freely available high-resolution protein structures, will be employed as the starting point to create novel classes of protein-based 2D materials. Layered protein structures will be identified in the PDB, in which close contacts are observed within the layer and long contacts are observed between layers. Computational and rational design methods will be used to strengthen interaction within a layer and further weaken or abrogate interactions between layers. Using this approach, one need not explicitly design the structure from first principles, but can instead create nanosheets from proteins that have a demonstrated propensity to form 2D layers.

The PDB represents a rich trove of structural information on biomolecules. Many structures comprise layers of biomolecules, i.e., arrangements in which contact areas are more extensive within at least one crystallographically defined plane than between planes. In principle, the lateral interfaces within appropriately chosen crystal structures can be computationally optimized to enhance the cohesive interactions between protomers, while axial interactions are attentuated through weakening or blocking of the lamination of layers. This investigation comprises a proof-of-principle directed toward the hypothesis that crystallographically characterized layered structures can be used as a starting point to engineer and structurally diversify crystalline 2D peptide and protein assemblies through computational optimization of protomer interfaces. The research plan of this proposal encompasses three specific aims in support of the preceding hypothesis. The first two aims focus on the validation of this computationally-driven approach with respect to the design of two specific classes of 2D peptide materials targets that represent potential substrates for high value-added applications, namely open framework (porous) lattices and polar 2D crystals. We anticipate that success in these two aims will experimentally validate the feasibility and scope of this approach with respect to materials design, while simultaneously providing access to novel 2D nanomaterials. In the third specific aim, structural data resulting from the materials generated in specific aims 1 and 2 will be employed as input for additional rounds of computational design in order to create multi-component 2D nanostructures in which the tectons are chemically distinguishable and independently addressable on the nanoscale. In each specific aim, computational methods will be employed initially to optimize the structurally critical interfaces between protomers. Candidate peptides will be synthesized and screened using higher throughput, low-resolution experimental methods.

Yet despite decades of research, ecology still faces a glaring paradox: many invasion theories are at odds with one another, but each is supported by strong evidence. The paradox exists because most studies are conducted in only one of three key ecological dimensions: scale, space, and time. This project will take a cross-scale approach from small stream segments to whole watersheds across the landscape at numerous time steps. In doing so, this work will use a macrosystems framework to link invasion theories with empirical evidence across all three dimensions to further our understanding of how species invasions happen and how to prevent or manage them.

This work will be conducted in the Mississippi River Basin; rivers provide a unique opportunity for studying scale-dependent invasion processes because watersheds create discrete boundaries of fish species distribution. Accordingly, many of the most prolific invaders arrive not from distant continents, but from nearby watersheds. Native status for riverine fishes is thus scale-dependent, which affects how invasions are conceptualized and modeled. Using rich datasets of historical and contemporary fish distribution, this project takes a three-pronged approach: 1) using Bayesian tools to quantify invasion drivers across spatial scales; 2) linking concepts from metacommunity and invasion ecology to investigate invasion network dynamics across space; and 3) predicting trajectories of species invasions through time.

The temperature in the thermosphere varies in response to solar energy input and auroral events at high latitudes and is also closely related to the atmospheric density.  This improved model will help better predict the atmospheric temperature and density in the thermosphere.  Since the density is the key parameter that determines satellite drag, this improvement will help better predict satellite drag and space weather in response to changes in solar radiation and associated disturbances in Earth\\u2019s electromagnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new model is referred to with the acronym EXTEMPLAR, for EXospheric TEMperatures on a PoLyhedrAl gRid. The method relies on converting satellite density measurements into exospheric temperatures and sorting these values into bins based on their location on a geodesic grid. By fitting the data in each bin to the environmental conditions at the time, maps of the exospheric temperature can be obtained from the regression coefficients. These temperatures can be used to obtain neutral densities at any location and altitude, by substituting for the values in the empirical model of the thermosphere by the Naval Research Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project activities include: (1) Measuring the time delays between auroral energy inputs and exospheric temperature response, and how these delays vary around the globe.

The timings between the energy input and the thermosphere's response will be established as a function of global coordinates. The development of methods using triangulated geodesic grids has the potential to transform modeling and analysis techniques within the space science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful conclusion to this project will result in an empirical model that will be useful to other research in the scientific community, particularly those related to the objectives of the NSF CEDAR program, including simulations of the coupled, ionosphere/thermosphere system.

However, such a fusion gives rise to the so-called Black-Hole Information Paradox, which seems to challenge one of our most fundamental physical principles, namely the principle of locality, which states that objects can only interact if they are near each other.  But just as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was only a harbinger of all manner of quantum weirdness, the information paradox may presage other subtle violations of locality.  The goal of Professor Kaplan's research is to study some of these exotic phenomena in order to determine if the laws of physics, and in particular the principle of locality, can be maintained near black holes.  As a result, this research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science towards the discovery and understanding of fundamental physical principles.  This research project will also have broader impacts, as Professor Kaplan will involve graduate students in his research and plans to disseminate the results of this research through public talks.     <br/><br/>On a more technical level, Professor Kaplan aims to study locality in quantum gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.  In particular, he will focus on the following questions:  (1) How can the AdS/CFT correspondence make predictions for physical bulk observers beyond perturbation theory?  (2) Are previously-discovered non-perturbative locality violations in (2+1)-dimensional AdS space robust and physical?  (3) Can the impossibility of screening the gravitational field in AdS/CFT be demonstrated?  Professor Kaplan will use the AdS/CFT correspondence, the conformal bootstrap, and Virasoro symmetry to perform explicit calculations that will help to address these questions.  Professor Kaplan will also endeavor to interpret technical developments in CFT in terms of quantum gravity in AdS in order to shed light on the mysteries of black-hole evaporation and the limitations on locality in quantum gravity.

Moreover, during passage through thick continental crust, subduction zone magmas may substantially differentiate and melt crustal rocks giving rise to the great diversity of igneous lithologies characteristic of earth. Explosive volcanic eruptions at continental arc can have devastating global effects and owe their explosiveness to the composition and volume of magma stored in the crust. The development of large magma storage systems remains largely unknown and very controversial among volcanologists. This project will investigate how accumulated magma is stored and evolves over time. The investigators seek to characterize the processes and timescales of magma storage in the modern magma chambers beneath volcanoes in the Andean Central Volcanic Zone of Chile and Bolivia. Growing evidence suggests that the massive magmatic reservoirs required for largest and most explosive eruptions, such as those in the Central Andean Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex, are built rapidly in hot crustal environment. Over the 3-year project, graduate and undergraduate students will expand their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of geologists seeking to understand the dynamics of crustal melting and magma storage leading to volcanic eruptions. The project emphasizes training in analytical methods in the lab, in the field, and at collaborating facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on young volcanic rocks from composite volcano complexes in the Andean Central Volcanic Zone of Chile and Bolivia (Aucanquilcha, Ollag\\u00fce, Uturuncu, San Pedro-Linzor, Licancabur, Lazufre and Lascar) linked closely in space and time, to address the processes and timescales leading to the buildup of magma and eventual volcanic eruption. The primary intent of this project is to investigate how accumulated magma is stored and evolves over time. This will be accomplished by characterizing the processes and timescales of magma differentiation in the modern magma chambers and determining the influence of regional magma bodies on Central Andes volcanoes. New and existing samples from each center will be used to address three basic questions: 1) how long does magma reside at active individual centers; 2) do magmatic sources and partial melting processes vary systematically with the geochemical evolution of volcanic products; and 3) what is the evidence for involvement regional-scale upper crustal magma reservoirs in controlling eruptive composition? The proposed research will use targeted field sampling, whole rock geochemistry, 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, high precision zircon geochronology/geochemistry and trace element diffusion in plagioclase to address these questions.

Often the equations that one encounters are algebraic in nature, like those describing lines, circles, parabolas and the like, in contrast with, say, equations involving the trigonometric functions, or logarithms, or derivatives. Typically, the equations have infinitely many solutions---think about the equation defining a circle---and it is usually not possible to write down a complete list of solutions. Rather, the objective is to find ways to study the structure of the collection of the solution set, which is called a variety. A fruitful approach has been to consider the (algebraic) functions on the variety. These functions form a mathematical structure called a commutative ring, and my research has been dedicated to understanding these structures; not in the abstract, but in their various manifestations, which are galore, they arise in quite diverse contexts across mathematics and physics. Mathematics has also been remarkably successful in describing and studying phenomenon related to symmetry. This leads to another mathematical structure called a group. Intriguingly, in certain contexts, there is a way to attach a commutative ring---and a variety---to a group and in the past few years various researchers, including the PI, have been able to solve problems related to groups using tools that had been developed to study varieties. A part of the current project deals with these aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two major themes weave through this project. One is the study of invariants of finite free complexes over commutative noetherian local rings; the second is the modular representation theory of finite groups and group schemes. The former too is connected to groups via certain conjectures in the theory of transformation groups. These conjectures---due to Adem, Avramov, Browder, Buchweitz, Carlsson, Swan, Halperin and others---postulated lower bounds on the length of the homology modules, and on the total rank, of such complexes, when the homology has nonzero finite length. Recently the PI and Mark Walker found counterexamples for many of these conjectures. One set of problems outlined in this project are aimed at discovering and establishing the ``correct\\\" bounds for these invariants. Another set of projects seek to probe the structure of the stable module category of representations of a finite group, or finite group scheme, over a field of positive characteristic. The focus is on ``local strata\\\" and various finiteness conditions for modules in this strata; in particular, on dualizability and cohomological finiteness.

The project will provide educational and international research opportunities to two graduate students through training in geophysical, sedimentological, and palynological data acquisition, processing, and interpretation, thereby contributing towards a stronger geoscience workforce. The project will also reach out to a broader audience by visiting science classrooms in Missouri and presenting and sharing research results during STEM days for elementary and middle school female students at Missouri University of Science and Technology. Finally, involvement and collaboration with Guatemalan institutions will provide international research opportunities and collaborations and enhance transfer of knowledge among U.S. and Guatemalan collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.6930623054504395, \"y\": 5.931532859802246}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Building Adaptability for Teaching Online through Peer-Reviewed, Active-Learning Resources and Professional Development\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project aims to serve the national interest by helping life science college instructors teach online lessons using active-learning instructional practices housed in the CourseSource repository. This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 1 project will increase the number of published open educational resources (OERs) for a variety of undergraduate online classrooms (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous online classes, hybrid classrooms that combine in-person and online teaching). OERs are educational materials that are available in the public domain. CourseSource publishes peer-reviewed OERs that implement research-based, effective pedagogical techniques. Increasing the number of freely-available online OERs addresses an immediate need by providing lessons and professional development to instructors. It also addresses a long-term need by assembling an extensive set of resources that meet the growing demand for online education. Because CourseSource has built a diverse and large community who uses its materials, this project will directly improve instruction for hundreds of instructors and thousands of undergraduate biology students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unifying goal of this project will be to share effective online lessons and help biology instructors implement them to benefit their students. Furthermore, advancing the progress and development of peer-reviewed, pedagogically sound OER materials can benefit the larger academic landscape as it moves towards providing low- or no-cost access to high-quality resources for instructors and students. This project will: 1) Use information from the OERs published in CourseSource to determine how instructors implement active-learning instructional strategies online, 2) Evaluate short- and long-term online professional development programs designed to help instructors find, adapt, implement, and share online lessons, and 3) Explore how OERs can support instructors in using online lessons that include active-learning pedagogies. Since CourseSource publications include a section in which authors delineate their instructional approaches, they can be mined to determine the type and frequency of active-learning practices as well as alignment with instructional design practices, the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, and evidence-based strategies for online instruction. The results will identify strategies that will easily transfer across contexts, situations where instructors need greater support to initiate and maintain these practices in online environments, and ways active-learning can be enhanced by the online format. This project will also create multiple professional development programs for instructors in which they learn to write about and publish their online lessons and implement previously published OERs. These programs will be assessed through surveys and a Social Network Analysis. The results will allow the exploration of whether and how instructor beliefs about online teaching change, and if professional development programs can create and sustain instructor support networks. Finally, interviews with instructors who are implementing OERs in their classroom will be used to determine how the availability of instructional materials influences instructor pedagogical decisions.

Instead, rain that falls on cities runs off the buildings and roads. Cities are spending billions of dollars to manage this extra water. They are investing in green infrastructure, which is infrastructure on the land that can soak up and hold rainwater. One of these green infrastructure approaches is storm water ponds. However, across the southeastern U.S., beaver live in urban streams, and they build ponds, too. Beaver are considered a nuisance species and are often killed, even though their ponds may be similar to storm water ponds for slowing water and improving water quality. The first goal of this project is to compare how well beaver ponds store water during both dry and wet periods compared to storm water ponds. In addition to retaining and slowing the flow of storm water from cities, both beaver and storm water ponds receive nutrients than can feed algae blooms. The second goal of this project is to evaluate if urban beaver ponds increase the storage of nutrients and sediments from water that passes through their dams. This is important because it will improve downstream water quality. The final goal of this project is to map where beaver may be building these ponds in urban areas. This will inform city managers on what to do with the ponds. To determine if the ponds work the same way in different cities, this work will be conducted in Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC, and Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC. The project will provide multiple broader impacts, including increasing diversity in the geosciences, collaborating with conservation groups, such as Adopt-a-Stream and Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, to educate the general public about the benefits of beaver, and helping local watershed managers to better manage beaver and adopt benefits that might exist from their ponds.  In addition, this research will be done at multiple minority serving institutions by a diverse group of investigators. The multi-institution project will allow students to collaborate across institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test a conceptual model of how the physical features of urban beaver and stormwater ponds impact streamflow attenuation and water quality. Cities are spending billions of dollars on installing green infrastructure to capture stormwater runoff, when cities in the southeastern U.S. may have infrastructure that fills a similar role already in beaver ponds. The functioning of beaver ponds compared to stormwater ponds has not been systematically studied anywhere. This project aims at (1) quantifying the nutrient and sediment retention of beaver and stormwater ponds, (2) quantifying the transit time of water through beaver and stormwater ponds and floodplain-stream reconnection around dams at both high and low flow, and (3) using remote sensing products and GIS to estimate the total number of beaver ponds in cities and scale-up quantification of retention to the whole-city scale. The hypothesis for objectives 1 and 2 is that the hydrologic and nutrient retention response of the pond will be driven by the hydrologic source of the water\\u2014specifically inflows dominated by surface or groundwater\\u2014and readily quantifiable metrics of pond geomorphology. The hypothesis for objective 3 is that identified ponded water from aerial imagery can be combined with the drivers of beaver habitat, including stream slope and vegetation, to pinpoint locations of beaver activity. The project entails conducting field work on urban beaver dams and stormwater ponds in the Piedmont cities of Atlanta, GA, and Charlotte and Raleigh, NC to compare influent to effluent mass fluxes of nutrients and total suspended solids (TSS) over two years, sample hyporheic waters in the dam and floodplain to understand nutrient cycling in the sediments and quantify travel time distributions of water through beaver ponds and how they compare to engineered stormwater ponds. The proposed research will develop a conceptual framework through rigorous testing using intensive field studies that will yield new and transformative knowledge within the field of urban hydrological science. The study will be carried across a range of factors, including pond size, watershed land use, sediment, geology, and infrastructure age to assess controlling drivers and predict the response in other systems. In addition, larger-scale mapping of these systems will help to evaluate landscape-level impacts on entire cities.In addition to the intellectual merits, this project will increase diversity in STEM by recruiting underrepresented students to complete M.S. degrees at minority serving institutions, mentored by a diverse group of faculty. The project will also entail public outreach on the ecological benefits of beaver leveraging existing relationships with non-profit conservation groups. Beaver are considered a nuisance species, and thus to reap the benefits their ponds may have on hydrologic and nutrient retention, conversations between watershed managers and beaver pond neighbors must be facilitated to allow for science-based decisions on the fate of these ponds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.852314472198486, \"y\": 5.811993598937988}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"NSF Student Travel Grant for 2020 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This award is to assist US-based students to attend the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom) to be held in Austin, Texas, March 23-27, 2020.

Gestures are a type of action\\u2013\\u2013an action done in the air that does not directly affect objects. Both gestures and actions-on-objects can promote learning, but having gesture as part of a math lesson makes it easier to remember and extend that lesson than having action as part of the lesson. This program of research uses neural data to figure out why. Two hypotheses, both of which might be correct, are possible: (1) Gesture promotes learning by helping children abstract beyond particular exemplars used in instruction. (2) Action impedes learning by tying children to the particulars of the exemplars used in instruction. It is difficult to disentangle these two mechanisms at the behavioral level because both hypotheses lead to the same outcome\\u2013\\u2013better learning following gesture than action. The research uses neuroimaging to measure activity during a math lesson and determine whether different areas of the brain are activated during gesture- vs. action-based instruction. Understanding the neural processes that underlie learning through gesture vs. action can help distinguish between these two hypotheses, and lead to more finely tuned recommendations to teachers for using these tools in the classroom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program aims to distinguish between the two hypotheses in a math lesson under two conditions: when children observe an instructor produce gestures or actions (Study 1); when children themselves produce gestures or actions (Study 2). Study 1 uses fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and Study 2 uses fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) to measure neural activity while 8- to 10-year-old children in 3rd and 4th grade receive gesture- or action-based instruction in the pre-algebra concept of math equivalence (the notion that two sides of an equation must be equal). Neural activity in abstraction areas is expected to occur during gesture instruction; neural activity in object areas is expected to occur during action instruction). Differences in neural processes during instruction will be used to predict children\\u2019s learning outcomes after instruction. fNIRS is a new technology that has been underused in educational neuroscience, but has the potential to be used in the classroom to measure neural activity during learning from multiple students simultaneously.

This project investigates how both tardigrades and the mosses they inhabit are able to tolerate periodic desiccation and aims to understand how traits important in desiccation tolerance have evolved in both groups. This CAREER project offers exceptional opportunities for student engagement in research and aims to train diverse, budding scientists in integrative and collaborative biodiversity research to increase retention of students from groups typically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.

Sustaining this growth is challenging and requires both technological and regulatory innovations that increase the wireless spectrum utilization, in order to be able to accommodate more data traffic within the finite spectrum resource. The exponential increase in traffic demand is expected to continue with the deployment of 5G networks and beyond, hence placing additional challenges that need innovative solutions. Despite more than a decade of intense research activity on dynamic spectrum sharing, there are still fundamental open questions regarding spectrum policies and their impact on spectrum utilization. This project helps meet these challenges, by providing tools and mathematical foundations that enable regulators, and the research community, to understand and design efficient spectrum sharing policies leading to wireless broadband networks that are more capable of carrying more traffic than what is envisioned today.

In this approach, the revenue processes and customer demands are modeled as stochastic processes. A regulator is modeled as an entity that attempts to set spectrum policies that maximize spectrum utilization given various levels of knowledge, or lack thereof, of the stochastic and complex dynamics of the market. This sets up a stochastic optimization framework that makes it possible to compare different spectrum regulatory policies as a function of the market. In addition, it also characterizes the optimal values of the parameters of the spectrum policies that achieve the optimal (maximum) spectrum utilization for a given market. It also provides real-time randomized algorithms for operators to optimize their spectrum portfolios without prior knowledge of the market/spectrum dynamics. Thus this framework captures both regulator and operator perspectives.

These nanoribbons are strips (50-100 thousand times thinner than a human hair) of graphene: a sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a rigid structure that resembles chicken wire. Graphene nanoribbons come in two different structural forms, armchair and zigzag.  Armchair graphene nanoribbons have emerged as attractive organic materials for potential applications in high-speed, light-weight and flexible electronic devices.  Zigzag graphene nanoribbons represent promising materials for developing efficient spintronic (spin-electronic) devices.  To date, the efficient and practical synthesis of water-soluble and processable graphene has not been possible.  The Dong group is combining physical organic chemistry knowledge with advanced tools of transition-metal catalysis to overcome the synthetic challenges and the processability problem.  The development of scalable synthetic approaches for the production of pure forms of armchair and zigzag nanoribbons opens the way for novel applications of these materials in nanoelectronics, spintronic and quantum computing devices.

The objectives are to realize solution-phase synthesis of aGNRs and zGNRs with precisely installed piperazine side chains. The key synthetic challenge is to exploit the newly developed palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis to prepare these unique monomers for GNR synthesis. Compared to the existing approaches of GNR synthesis, the merits of the new strategies include: monomers that are prepared in a streamlined manner from commercially available chemicals; redundant bulky side chains that are avoided for better imaging of the material edge structures; and products that are expected to exhibit high solubility and processability in aqueous solutions. The successful implementation of the research may address two long-standing challenges: synthesis of water-soluble GNRs and solution-phase preparation of zGNRs, which are critical factors for solution processability of these materials and the development of graphene-based spintronic devices. The research facilitates the physical and theoretical studies of these intriguing materials, as many of those aGNRs and zGNRs may be made for the first time in the lab and then used to validate or examine various theoretical models and hypotheses proposed previously by physicists and physical chemists.

Optimal control problems are a systematic tool to infer knowledge from data, enabling scientific discovery and decision making. They are typically formulated as data-fitting problems with dynamical systems (the simulation problem) as constraints. This simulation problem describes the possible behavior of a natural or engineered system under investigation for given values of input variables (for example, brain tumor and tumor growth rates). In practice, the values are typically not known and cannot be measured directly. One needs to infer them from observational data (for example, a series of patient images) by optimizing a performance goal. This process constitutes the control problem; the unknown variables are the controls of the simulation problem. Solving optimal control problems poses significant mathematical challenges. The project will consider control problems that can have up to billions of unknowns. For decision making, one needs to equip the solutions of the control problem with confidence intervals. This is achieved using a statistical framework, which adds massive computational costs. Moreover, distinct control variable realizations can yield simulation outputs that match the observational data equally well, leading to what is known as ill-posed problems. To alleviate this ambiguity, prior knowledge about plausible solutions can be introduced based on regularization models. However, choosing adequate regularization models remains a significant challenge. This project aims to provide fast, scalable, and robust software tailored to modern computing architectures to address the massive computational costs. The project will focus on learning appropriate regularization models from data. The area of application is statistical shape analysis for classifying objects, and, in particular, the classification of patients (diseased versus healthy) based on the anatomical shape variability of organs. Upon completion, the research will produce a generic mathematical and algorithmic framework for transport-related optimal control problems and more generally inverse problems, along with software infrastructure that applies to a range of problems in (biomedical) imaging sciences, atmospheric sciences, computer vision, remote sensing, data science, and deep learning. The project will provide training for two graduate students and summer research projects for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop effective, scalable computational methods for nonlinear optimal control of geodesic flows of diffeomorphisms. The novelty is the design of hardware-accelerated computational kernels and efficient numerical schemes that exploit problem structure and rigorously follow mathematical principles for studying shape variability. This is achieved through the design of a Bayesian framework for statistical shape analysis. The quantification of shape variability of distinct realizations of an object under investigation is done through the lens of geodesic flows of diffeomorphisms that map one object to another. In particular, one quantifies the proximity between two shapes by the length of the geodesic path that connects them. From a statistical point of view, one can study shape variability in a database by identifying an average geometry (the \\\"statistical template\\\") of a particular object under investigation, and then studies how individual datasets deviate from this average. The project will focus on adaptive, hierarchical numerical schemes, enabling high-accuracy computations if desired, and low-accuracy approximations when possible. The solvers will feature fast computational kernels, maximizing single-node, and single-GPU throughput while maintaining scalability on (heterogeneous) high-performance computing platforms. Work packages include preconditioning, fast hierarchical computational kernels for evaluating forward and adjoint operators, mixed-precision implementations on heterogeneous architectures, and computational methods that exploit problem structure to speed up the solution and allow for high acceptance rates when sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions. In particular, the project will provide methodology for (i) the solution of nonlinear initial value control problems, (ii) uncertainty quantification, (iii) statistical template estimation from large imaging databases, and (iv) learning regularization operators from data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.900689125061035, \"y\": 9.13894271850586}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"EAGER: Effects of radiation on life history  in \\u201cresurrected\\u201d Daphnia lineages exposed to fallout from 1950s atmospheric nuclear testing\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Between 1951 and 1962, the U.S. Department of Energy detonated one hundred nuclear weapons during above-ground testing at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), near Las Vegas. The resulting fallout deposited radioactivity across much of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Together with hundreds more tests around the world, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, as well as the 1986 and 2011 accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi power plants, it is clear that the atomic age has increased radioactive exposure for human and non-human organisms around the globe. In the short term, radiation exposure raises rates of genetic change (i.e., mutation) and negatively affects survival and reproduction for most organisms tested. In the long term, however, the evolutionary impacts of radiation exposure are not yet clear. Do mutation rates stay elevated over time? Do populations adapt to withstand radiation exposure? Do survival and reproduction stay depressed or recover? Answers to these questions are directly relevant to the long term health of human and non-human populations near places like Fukushima and Chernobyl. They are more broadly relevant to long-standing questions about how mutation rate and natural selection interact during adaptation. Several undergraduates and two graduate students will be trained in diverse laboratory and bioinformatic analyses, including members of underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project asks: how have wild populations evolved following radiation exposure? This is a difficult question to answer because science is often missing baseline, pre-radiation population data. Moreover, for many organisms, only a few generations have passed since irradiation. This project overcomes both of these problems using an organism with short generation times and an approach called resurrection ecology. Resurrection ecology is the collection of historical population samples in the form of dormant eggs that have been deposited through time in sediments. In particular, this research focuses on dormant eggs of small, freshwater crustaceans in the genus Daphnia. Daphnia create annual egg deposits that spend the winter on lake bottoms before hatching in the spring. Some of these eggs do not hatch, however, because they are buried by sediment. This study will take sediment cores from lakes inside and out of the NTS radioactive fallout zone to collect dormant Daphnia eggs deposited before, during, and after above ground nuclear testing. The researchers will hatch eggs from those eras and raise offspring in laboratory conditions to measure rates of hatching, survival, and reproduction. If radiation exposure negatively impacted these populations, then researchers expect that populations from sediments deposited during and shortly after nuclear testing will have relatively low rates of survival and reproduction. If populations adapt to radiation exposure over time, the researchers predict that more recent resurrections will have higher rates of survival and reproduction, on par with pre-nuclear populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.242025375366211, \"y\": 5.219199180603027}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"I-Corps:  Plasmonic Microarray Chips for Microbial Identification\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enhance the development of plasmonic microchips that enable microbial analysis in complex samples.

This need is forcefully advanced by policy leaders including the National Research Council and the College Board. They point out that learning is more effective when students organize and link information within a consistent knowledge framework, which is what big ideas should provide. Unfortunately, finding ways to teach big ideas effectively\\u2014so they become useful as knowledge frameworks\\u2014 is a significant challenge. Deep structure modeling (DSM), the innovation advanced in this project, is designed to meet this challenge in the context of high school biology. In DSM, students learn a big idea as the underlying, or \\u201cdeep\\u201d structure of a set of examples that contain the structure, but with varying outward details. As learners begin to apprehend the deep structure (i.e., the big idea) within the examples, they use the tools and procedures of scientific modeling to express and develop it. According to theories of learning that undergird DSM, the result of this process should be a big idea that is flexible, meaningful, and easy to express, thus providing an ideal framework for making sense of new information learners encounter (i.e., learning with the big idea). To the extent that this explanation is born out in rigorous research tests and within authentic curriculum materials, it contributes important knowledge about how teaching and learning can be organized around big ideas, and not only for deep structural modeling but for other instructional approaches as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has twin research and prototype development components. Both are taking place in the context of high school biology, in nine classrooms across three districts, supporting up to 610 students. The work focuses on three design features of DSM: (1) embedding model source materials with intuitive, mechanistic ideas; (2) supporting learners to abstract those ideas as a deep structure shared by a set of sources; and (3) representing this deep structure efficiently within the model. In combination, these features support students to understand an abstract, intuitively rich, and efficient knowledge structure that they subsequently use as a framework to interpret, organize, and link disciplinary content. A series of five research studies build on one another to develop knowledge about whether and how the design features bring about these anticipated effects. Earlier studies in the sequence are small-scale classroom experiments randomly assigning students to either deep structural modeling or to parallel, non modeling controls. Measures discriminate for the anticipated effects during learning and on posttests. Later studies use qualitative methods to carefully trace the anticipated effects over time and across topics. As a group, these studies are contributing generalized knowledge of how learners can effectively abstract and represent big ideas and how these ideas can be leveraged as frameworks for learning content with understanding. Two research-tested biology curriculum prototypes are being developed as the studies evolve: a quarter-year DSM biology curriculum centered on energy; and an eighth-year DSM unit centered on natural selection.

In string theory, a branch of theoretical physics, algebraic varieties are used to describe fine pieces of our universe. In this theory, everything is made of tiny strings which travel through spacetime, and trace out algebraic curves in some algebraic varieties. Gromov-Witten invariants, originating from physics, are virtual counts of algebraic curves in algebraic varieties satisfying prescribed incidence constraints. They are used in physic to describe the structures of our universe. They also provide new approaches and insights to classical problems from algebraic geometry. Despite their importance, these invariants are very difficult to compute. The primary goal of this project is to develop a new method to calculate Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the boundary of the gauged linear sigma model from physics using tools of logarithmic structures from algebraic geometry. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project focuses on studying the geometry of the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) using stable log maps of Abramovich-Chen-Gross-Siebert. The GLSM proposed by Witten in the 1990s can be viewed as a deep generalization of the hyper-plane property of Gromov-Witten invariants in all genus. However, the moduli stacks in GLSM which carry the perfect obstruction theory for defining GLSM invariants are in general non-proper. This presents a major difficulty in calculating GLSM invariants. Recently, log compactifications of hybrid-type GLSM were constructed by Chen, Janda, and Ruan using stable log maps. These compactifications provide proper moduli stacks carrying a reduced perfect obstruction theory whose associated virtual cycles recover the GLSM virtual cycles.

The research component of this project fills the resulting gaps in our understanding. The project demonstrates when attempts to improve science not only further entrench (or even amplify) current injustices, but backfire, ultimately impeding scientific progress.

This project aims to develop novel algorithms to discover governing rules that explain the observed behaviors (i.e., trajectories) of dynamical systems. Discovery of underlying models, while useful for analysis and control, can be computationally challenging. For example, traditional modeling methods rely on derivatives, and can be hampered by even modest amounts of measurement noise that derails numerical differentiation. Such methods treat each measurement of the output of a dynamical system as a separate data point. The data points are then related back to the underlying model using numerical differentiation. Instead, in this project, the entire trajectory is treated as a unit of interest. The sequence of measured data points is treated as a sampled, noisy representation of that trajectory, and is related back to the underlying model using numerical integration. It is hypothesized that treating trajectories of dynamical systems as the fundamental unit of data can yield better data-driven techniques for analysis and control of dynamical systems, and this project aims to develop such data-driven identification and verification techniques.

The occupation kernels are tied to the original dynamics through a densely defined operator, the Liouville operator. Occupation kernels and Liouville operators result in a nontrivial generalization of contemporary methods that study finite-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems by lifting them into infinite dimensional linear programs over the spaces of measures. The proposed approach facilitates lifting into linear programs over function spaces instead of measure spaces, and as a result, tools from function theory and approximation theory become available for design and analysis of algorithms.

Despite recent efforts to reconstruct the magnitude and spatial distribution of major post-glacial climate events in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Antarctic Climate Reversal, Little Ice Age), key gaps in proxy data, most notably in Australia, hinder these reconstructions; this gap reflects a dearth of sites on the continent that preserve high resolution, continuous paleoclimate records. The alpine tarns in Kosciuszko National Park (KNP), New South Wales, represent notable exceptions to this problem: five tarns have acted as continuous sediment traps since deglaciation 18,000-20,000 years ago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All lakes in KNP freeze during the peak of the Austral winter (July-September), which provides stable surfaces for deep coring. Blue Lake was previously cored in the 1970\\u2019s, and although analyses of those cores were limited, they indicated that the lake has trapped sediment continuously since deglaciation (&gt;18,000 years ago). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a small grant from Western Washington University (WWU), the researchers collected a pilot core from the lake in 2016 in order to test the viability of collecting continuous records from the lake.  Initial analysis of the core on an ITRAX multi-scanner demonstrates that the sediments are well preserved and highly structured. Both visual and X-ray imagery indicate sub-centimeter scale strata throughout the core; based on the age estimates from above, this stratigraphy would provide sub-centennial resolution (ca. 20 year/cm) throughout the core. If borne out by dating, such resolution would be unprecedented in southern Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This single core demonstrates the exceptional stratigraphic record preserved in Blue Lake alone, and implies that similar, complementary records likely exist in the other, smaller tarns in the park. To test this, the researchers propose to core two additional tarns in the park: Lake Albina, and Club Lake; although shallower than Blue Lake, both occupy bedrock basins and so are less susceptible to lake-level fluctuations related to droughts than sediment dammed lakes. Their differing sizes, depths, and basin geometries might provide complementary records to Blue Lake, allowing the researchers to distinguish between local and regional signals based on correlation testing of the cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to collecting cores, a suite of analyses to test the paleoclimate potential of cores from these lakes will be conducted at University of Canterbury/University of Queensland by Australian collaborators under existing Australian funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts include providing new data and insights into the frequency and magnitude of possible past droughts and temperature variations as well as informing resource managers in local agencies and water and power utility companies.

This academic/industrial collaboration seeks deeper understanding of the role of hardware interfaces in limiting the performance of current 2D-LC approaches.  The research also seeks to develop innovative interfaces that will improve the speed and other performance metrics of analyses based on 2D-LC, while decreasing their cost. These innovations may be useful to scientists and engineers facing the need for detailed analysis of complex materials such as new protein-based drugs, chemical products based on renewable starting materials, and biofluids (including blood and urine) for which better analyses can enhance the understanding and diagnosis of disease.  Dr. Stoll involves students at the high school and undergraduate levels in this cutting-edge research to prepare them to become the workforce of the future.  He also develops simulations to facilitate learning about liquid chromatography and the more effective use of the technique across many sectors of the U.S. economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the majority of practical 2D-LC methods, the two separations are coupled using a valve-based interface that transfers small fractions of material exiting the first column to the inlet of the second column for further separation. Despite its critical role in the effectiveness of 2D-LC separations, innovation in the area of interface technology has been sluggish. The valves in common use today are conceptually quite similar to those used for the first 2D-LC separations four decades ago, and have weaknesses that negatively impact the performance of 2D-LC with respect to reliability, ease-of-use, and separation power. In this project, the Stoll Group is evaluating several innovative interface designs that either eliminate the valve entirely, or redefine the function of the valve in ways that have the potential to change the interface from a point of weakness to a point of strength of 2D-LC technology. As part of these studies they are evaluating the impact of different interface designs on other aspects of the system, such as the lifetime of second dimension columns.

It has been shown that VC can provide greater computing power, at lower cost, than conventional approaches such as organizational computing centers and commercial clouds. BOINC is the most common software framework for VC. Essentially, donors of computing time simply have to load BOINC on their computer or smartphone, and then register to donate at the BOINC web site. VC provides \\\"high throughput computing\\\": handling lots of independent jobs, with performance goals based on the rate of job completion rather than completion time for individual jobs. This type of computing (all known as high-throughput computing) is in great demand in most areas of science. Until now, the adoption of VC has been limited by its structure. For example, VC projects (such as Einstein@home and Rosetta@home) are operated by individual research groups, and volunteers must browse and choose from among many such projects. As a result, there are relatively few VC projects, and volunteers are mostly tech-savvy computer enthusiasts.  This project aims to solve these problems using two complementary development efforts: First, it will add BOINC-based VC conduits to two major high-performance computing providers: (a) the Texas Advanced Computing Center, a supercomputer center, and (b) nanoHUB, a web portal for nano science that provides computing capabilities.Also, a unified control interface to VC will be developed, tentatively called Science United, where donors can register.  The project  will benefit thousands of scientists who use these facilities, and it will create technology that makes it easy for other HPC providers to add their own VC back ends. Also, Science United will provide a simpler interface to BOINC volunteers where they will register to support scientific areas, rather than specific projects. Science United will also serve as an allocator of computing power among projects. Thus, new projects will no longer have to do their own marketing and publicity to recruit volunteers. Finally, the creation of a single VC \\\"brand\\\" (i.e Science United) will allow coherent marketing of VC to the public. By creating a huge pool of low-cost computing power that will benefit thousands of scientists, and increasing public awareness of and interest in science, the project plans to establish VC as a central and long-term part of the U.S. scientific cyber infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding VC to an existing HPC facility involves several technical issues, which will be addressed as follows: (1) Packaging science applications (which typically run on Linux cluster nodes) to run on home computers (mostly Windows, some Mac and Linux): the team is developing an approach using VirtualBox and Docker, in which the application and its environment (Linux distribution, libraries, executables) are represented as a set of layers comprising a Docker image, which is then run as a container within a Linux virtual machine on the volunteer device. This has numerous advantages: it reduces the work of packaging applications to near zero; it minimizes network traffic because a given Docker layer is downloaded to a host only once; and it provides a strong security sandbox so that volunteer computers are protected from buggy or malicious applications, (2) File management: Input and output files must be moved between existing private servers and public-facing servers that are accessible to the outside Internet. A file management system will be developed, based on Web RPCs, for this purpose. This system will use content-based naming so that a given file is transferred and stored only once. It also maintains job/file associations so that files can be automatically deleted from the public server when they are no longer needed. (3) Submitting and monitoring jobs:  BOINC provides a web interface for efficiently submitting and monitoring large batches of jobs. These were originally developed as part of a system to migrate HTCondor jobs to BOINC. This project is extending it to support the additional requirements of TACC and nanoHUB. Note that these new capabilities are not specific to TACC or nanoHUB: they provide the glue needed to easily add BOINC-based VC to any existing HTC facility. The team is also developing RPC bindings in several languages (Python, C++, PHP). The other component of the project, Science United, is a database-driven web site and an associated web service for the BOINC clients. Science United will control volunteer hosts (i.e. tell them which projects to work for) using BOINC's \\\"Account Manager\\\" mechanism, in which the BOINC client on each host periodically contacts Science United and is told what projects to run. Project servers, not Science United, will distribute jobs and files. Science United will define a set of \\\"keywords\\\" for science areas (physics, biomedicine, environment, etc.) and for location (country, institution). Projects will be labelled with appropriate keywords. Volunteers will have a yes/no/maybe interface for specifying the types of jobs they want to run. Science United will thus provide a mechanism in which a fraction of total computing capacity can be allocated to a project for a given period. Because total capacity changes slowly over time, this allows near-certain guaranteed allocations. Science United will embody a scheduling system that attempts to enforce allocations, honor volunteer preferences, and maximize throughput. Finally, Science United will do detailed accounting of computing. Volunteer hosts will tell Science United how much work (measured by CPU time and FLOPs, GPU time and FLOPs, and number of jobs) they have done for each project. Science United will maintain historical records of this data for volunteers and projects, and current totals with finer granularity (e.g. for each host/project combination). Finally, Science United will provide web interfaces letting volunteers see their contribution status and history, and letting administrators add projects, control allocations, and view accounting data.\", \"x\": 3.824302911758423, \"y\": 9.644286155700684}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Scholarships, Community, and High-impact Practices to Improve Undergraduate Student Success in Computer Science and Engineering\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at the University of Louisville.

Two cohorts of five first-year students will receive up to four-years of scholarship support, and two cohorts of five transfer or junior students will receive up to two-year scholarships. The project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields by linking scholarships with effective supporting activities including mentoring, undergraduate research experiences, service learning, graduate school preparation, and outreach efforts to complement the university\\u2019s emerging collaboration with the local and national technological workforce. The project also aims to improve both STEM retention rates and overall graduation rates of scholars through exposure to improved computer science and engineering gateway courses and access to state-of-the-art technological tools and resources.

The project has four specific objectives: (1) to increase the number of enrolled low-income, academically talented students in computer science and engineering over a five-year period; (2) to achieve retention rates of at least 90% in Year 1 and 80% in Year 2 and Year 3, and to improve graduation rates significantly for participating S-STEM scholars; (3) to ensure that at least 90% of the project participants obtain career-related employment or enroll in a graduate program within six months of graduation; and (4) to advance understanding of the effectiveness of the proposed educational activities in improving the retention and graduation rates of low-income, academically talented students in computer science and engineering. Students from low-income backgrounds often work more hours, have fewer social connections, and are less likely to take a full-time course load or enroll continuously from one semester to the next. These factors adversely impact retention and graduation prospects. In addition to providing students with improved financial stability through scholarships and the potential for emotional support through cohort identity and community, this project will adapt and implement high-quality evidence-based practices to improve retention, graduation, and employability. These strategies include the improvement of computer science and engineering gateway courses, better preparation of students for engineering co-ops and employment, training of undergraduate teaching assistants for the purpose of gateway course support, bi-weekly cohort meetings and networking to build a sense of community.

Liquid crystal elastomers are rubbery materials that can reversibly change from one shape to another in response to changes in their environment. This shape change occurs without requiring external power and control equipment, which is particularly useful in implantable medical devices where water can disrupt circuitry, batteries are difficult to charge, and space is limited. This research effort will enable the synthesis and fabrication of liquid crystal elastomers, with dimensions smaller than a human hair, which bend, stretch, or twist near body temperature. These small structures will be able to penetrate tissue and the subsequent shape change will enable strong adhesion of synthetic materials to soft, wet, and moving tissues of the human body. This new strategy will address a critical national need for improved tissue adhesives. For example, many common treatments, such as hernia repair, require synthetic materials to adhere to the soft tissue, and adhesion failure leads to increased healthcare-related costs and pain.

The large, programmable, and reversible shape change of liquid crystal elastomers make these materials ideal candidates for the design of active microstructures. This work will overcome three critical limitations currently preventing the use of liquid crystal elastomers in biomedical applications: 1) the temperatures that induce shape change of these materials are too high for use in biomedical applications, 2) the biodegradability of these materials is uncontrolled, and 3) the shape change is difficult to program in 3D microscale structures.

These changes can affect the extent of boreal wetlands as well as their ability to sequester and transform C and other nutrients. In 2005, the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) was created to examine the role of changing soil climate and vegetation on peatland C cycling. Over the past fifteen years, core data has been collected on soil moisture and temperature, plant composition and amount, and the fluxes of important atmospheric gases emitted (as methane and carbon dioxide) from water table treatments that simulate floods and droughts. A key result from this group's prior investigations was that C emissions from this experimental site appeared to be high, regardless of water table position, revealing that interactions among changes in plant species composition in response to the treatments were strongly controlling the ability of this ecosystem to retain C.  This is a five-year renewal of a Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) project, DEB-1354370. The study is examining the interactions among changes in hydrology, plant species composition and changes in climate (particularly flooding and drought) in controlling C storage in this peatland complex; this work is necessary for understanding the consequences of an altered climate for C cycle processes.  Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will all be trained and in field and laboratory techniques. Results from the research will also be incorporated into new high school curricula for use in the Fostering Science summer camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current view of peatland carbon cycling is that the majority of soil carbon mineralization occurs in the relatively shallow aerated peat layer above the water table (acrotelm), and that deeper peat carbon occurring in anoxic layers (catotelm) undergoes minimal decomposition. As such, the position of the water table (and the associated thickness of the acrotelm) is used as a predictor of overall decomposition rates and long-term peat accumulation rates. However, findings from this team's fifteen-year manipulation of water table position in an Alaskan fen (Alaska Peatland Experiment, APEX) challenge this view, and in particular suggest that carbon mineralization in saturated peat is faster than previously expected, leading to high fluxes of anaerobic CO2 production. Prior analyses indicated no significant effect of water table position on ecosystem respiration, but it is possible that this result was due at least partially to changes in vegetation that have occurred both under lower (drier) and higher (wetter) water table positions. The initial experimental design could not disentangle the effects of changes in vegetation from hydrology on peat redox and C fluxes. As such, understanding the interactive effects of altered hydrology and vegetation on anaerobic decomposition processes, and how this governs the turnover of deep soil C pools in peatlands, was the prime objective of the first phase of LTREB funding. Results during that initial LTREB funding period showed that sedge and Equisetum (horsetail) rhizospheres indeed had oxidizing effects on peat and dissolved organic matter. However, persistent flooding over this period of research has presented key gaps in mechanistic understanding of controls on trace gas production in this system, and revealed that plant community structure and the dominance of algae likely have unique controls on soil redox processes and C fluxes. Flooding history also exerted strong control over the relative activity of algae vs. heterotrophic microorganisms, depending on changes in C substrates from different plants. Exactly how changes in plant community interact with altered water tables in governing the supply of electron donors and acceptors, and how this controls anaerobic metabolism in low- and high-water table years, are key questions this collaborative team will examine in the next five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.141852855682373, \"y\": 5.564631938934326}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Empowering Informal Educators to Prepare Future Generations in Wireless Radio Communications with Mobile Resources\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"&lt;p&gt;Wireless radio communications, such as Wi-Fi, transmit public and private data from one device to another, including cell phones, computers, medical equipment, satellites, space rockets, and air traffic control.

Hosts and their parasites are locked into an evolutionary battle: hosts evolve resistance, and parasites evolve to overcome this resistance. How the complexity of the landscape hosts and parasites inhabit affects this coevolution is unknown. Rivers are unique, highly complex ecosystems characterized by branching networks and downstream flow from high to low elevation. By affecting host and parasite population size and genetic diversity, these factors could alter the outcome of host-parasite coevolution. For example, differences between host and parasite in their ability to move upstream will affect the ability of each to evolve in response to the other and could generate localized differences in virulence or drug resistance. Parasites are ubiquitous in river systems, infecting both adjacent human populations and host species of economic and conservation interest. This research, using a well-studied fish and an economically important group of parasites, provides unique insight into the mechanisms shaping parasite ecology, biodiversity and evolution within rivers.

Lack of source code for most commercial software makes it necessary to analyze and defend software binaries. However, unlike source code, binaries are devoid of rich semantic information that is crucial for security. Traditional binary analysis and reverse engineering approaches are limited by factors such as obfuscation, choice of compiler and compilation flags, availability of debug information, and underlying instruction set architecture. This project bridges the semantic gap in binary analysis by leveraging the interface between a binary and its environment. Such interactions are mandated by the Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. The project is based on the insight that ABI adherence confers certain properties to a binary that form a strong basis for reverse engineering. Because ABI adherence is necessary for interoperability, relying on ABI cues for reverse engineering offers an unprecedented level of robustness that is impervious to obfuscation and compilation environment (e.g., optimization). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes two independent yet complementary mechanisms that leverage language ABIs to vastly improve the state of the art in binary analysis and code-reuse attack detection.

These poresomes will be used to deliver macromolecules to the cytoplasm while bypassing endosomes. Despite tremendous progress in nanoscience, the cytoplasmic delivery of membrane-impermeable compounds such as negatively charged RNA remains challenging. This is because a significant fraction of the RNA that is delivered remains trapped in the endosomes, where it ultimately degrades. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to overcome these challenges by engineering cell-mimicking RNA-loaded lipid vesicles that are equipped with pores composed of connexin membrane channels. It is hypothesized that microRNA(miRNA)-loaded poresomes will connect to the connexin membrane channels of recipient cells to form gap junctions. In this way, miRNAs will be directly delivered into the cytoplasm whilst bypassing the degradative endosomal and lysosomal environments (Objective 1). Further, to effectively load poresomes with therapeutic cargo, the PI proposes to synthesize EXOmers, RNA-based sequences that are capable of exploiting the cellular trafficking machinery used to actively sort macromolecules into poresomes. Structure activity analyses will be performed to develop highly efficient sequences (Objective 2).

Recent work has found that during early adolescence, Black youth can identify and articulate connections between systemic issues and inequities in their schooling experiences. Critical Consciousness theory suggests that without an awareness of oppression, marginalized groups cannot work to disrupt oppressive norms and societal inequities. To date, there has not been a psychometric tool that captures Black youth's cognitive understanding of racism, a specific form of oppression. An understanding of Black youth's cognitions around racism has the potential to provide empirical support for untested theoretical assumptions, enhance clinical approaches to addressing racial stress and trauma, and strengthen research approaches to examining the influence of racism in the lives of Black youth and their families.

One of the greatest mysteries in science is that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating, implying that a mysterious dark energy permeates the Universe and pushes on it.  The discovery of dark energy resulted in a Nobel Prize, but its nature is no clearer today than it was 20 years ago.  In fact, more recent measurements have led to less certainty, with different measurements of exactly how fast the Universe is expanding. CHIME is a new radio telescope designed to measure distant galaxies through the radio emission of neutral hydrogen gas that resides within them.  In order to measure the hydrogen emission, other bright radio signals from our own galaxy and other sources must be removed.  This foreground removal requires a precise understanding of the CHIME instrument itself.  This project will measure the instrument, improve nuisance radio emission removal, and combine the CHIME measurements with galaxy catalogues  to make a measurement of dark energy.  The program will also develop education-oriented radio receivers that will be used in STEM programs at MIT, WVU and Yale. Radio receivers for education have been developed through a partnership between WVU and the Green Bank Observatory to teach teachers the digital signal processing techniques necessary to build a digital spectrometer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis will be undertaken that cross-correlates 21cm maps from CHIME with optical galaxy survey data from eBOSS to measure the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. CHIME is designed to measure neutral hydrogen associated with galaxies at redshifts from 0.8 to 2.5, producing constraints on dark energy over a critical redshift range that is difficult to probe statistically with optical galaxy surveys alone. To make this measurement bright foreground emission from our own galaxy and extragalactic sources must be removed, which places stringent requirements on instrument calibration.  In this program the researchers will attempt to measure the expansion history through: (i) improved instrument beam modelling, (ii) demonstrated foreground removal techniques, and (iii) the measurement of large-scale structure with 21cm emission in cross-correlation with eBOSS optical galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.381120204925537, \"y\": 8.619366645812988}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"REU/RET Site: Physics REU and RET Programs at the University of Notre Dame\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site at the University of Notre Dame.

This project explores the different strategies that marginalized populations leverage in contexts where they are acutely vulnerable, to improve their access to resources. In addition to contributing to the training of a graduate student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, this project will have significant implications for organizations that seek to ease the socioeconomic transition and civic participation of asylum seekers and other migrants, potentially improving the effectiveness of reception programs and facilitating tailoring of services for particular populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project will examine the iterative processes by which two different groups of asylum seekers participating in a reception program at the same organization demonstrate that they are deserving of asylum by presenting themselves as both vulnerable and capable in various situations. Do the two populations strategize differently, and do they tend to play to their perceived strengths or attempt to compensate for their perceived weaknesses? How do their strategies change and develop over time in response to various experiences and interactions? Do organizational professionals work with each population differently, providing specific advice and guidance depending on each asylum seeker\\u2019s background?

This comparison offers the opportunity to parse through the differential effects of macro-level conditions on micro-level self-presentation strategies of different groups of people as they pursue common goals.

Thus, understanding how to control heat transfer at the nanoscale is critical in many engineering applications. Heat conduction in semiconductor crystals is dominated by collective atomic vibrations known as phonons. Conventionally, phonons are treated as particles that can propagate through a material, thus carrying heat, and can be scattered by material defects or other phonons. However, the wave nature of phonons can emerge or even dominate heat conduction in structures composed of periodically or quasi-periodically arranged components, e.g., quantum cascade lasers made of alternating layers of materials and integrated circuits containing densely packed nano-transistors. In those structures, the propagation of phonons can be promoted by constructive interference or halted by destructive interference. This project aims to explore these intriguing wave behaviors and elucidate the transition between particle-like and wave-like phonons through complementary computational and experimental techniques. This research will lead to novel engineering strategies to maximize heat dissipation in modern devices like quantum cascade lasers and integrated circuits or minimize heat conduction in thermoelectric materials and thermal barriers. This project will tightly integrate research, education, and outreach\\u2014including themed science exhibits, new curriculum development, hands-on research mentoring, and online course and research tool sharing\\u2014to have a broad, long-term impact on STEM education for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives of this project are to: 1) rigorously understand the transport, scattering, and localization of wave-like phonons in periodic, quasi-periodic, and aperiodic structures, leveraging complementary spectral phonon analysis and phonon spectroscopy techniques; and 2) minimize lattice thermal transport through decoupled suppression of wave-like and particle-like phonon transport, leveraging machine learning-aided spectral phonon analysis and structure optimization. The proposed research on the wave nature of phonons can greatly advance the state of knowledge of thermal transport in crystalline solids, which has until now been primarily based on the particle nature of phonons. Such knowledge will enable the development of novel engineering strategies based on the wave nature of phonons, breaking the bottleneck of the thermal design or management of various heat transfer-limited technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.08902645111084, \"y\": 8.457387924194336}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"MLWiNS: Resource Constrained Mobile Data Analytics Assisted by the Wireless Edge\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Increasing amounts of data are being collected on mobile telephones and internet-of-things (IoT) devices. Users are interested in analyzing this data to extract actionable information, for example, identifying objects of interest from high-resolution mobile phone pictures. The state-of-the-art technique for such data analysis is via deep learning which makes use of sophisticated software algorithms modeled on the functioning of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms are, however, too complex to run on small, battery constrained mobile devices. The alternative, i.e., transmitting data to the mobile base station where the deep learning algorithm can be executed on a powerful server, consumes too much bandwidth. This project seeks to devise new methods to compress data before transmission, thus reducing bandwidth costs while still allowing for the data to be analyzed at the base station. Departing from existing data compression methods optimized for reproducing the original images, the project will use deep learning itself to compress the data in a fashion that only keeps the critical parts of data necessary for subsequent analysis. The resulting deep learning based compression algorithms will be simple enough to run on mobile devices while drastically reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to mobile base stations for analysis, without significantly compromising the analysis performance. The proposed research will provide greater capability and functionality to mobile device users, enable extended battery lifetimes, and more efficient sharing of the wireless spectrum for analytics tasks.

Next, to efficiently adapt to varying wireless channel conditions, the project will seek to design adaptive DNN architectures that can operate at variable transmission rates and computational complexities. For instance, when the wireless channel quality drops, the proposed compression scheme will be able to quickly reduce transmission rate in response while ensuring the same analytics accuracy, but at the cost of greater computational power on the mobile device. Further, wireless channel allocation and scheduling policies that leverage the proposed adaptive DNN architectures will be developed to optimize the overall analytics accuracy at the server.

Examples include slurries encountered in mineral and ceramics processing, particle-filled molten plastics, and printing inks. In such particulate suspensions, the addition of a second immiscible liquid induces particle \\\"sticking\\\" and aggregation due to surface tension and capillary forces. A familiar example is a sandcastle whose strength comes from small water droplets which bind the sand grains together by capillary forces.

The deposited energy makes the regions appear very bright in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light and emit X-rays and less frequently gamma rays.  The sudden flashes of radiation, commonly known as EUV, X-ray, and gamma-ray flares or events, can be observed only using special detectors, because human eye is not sensitive to these wavelength bands.  Because solar eruptions occur quickly, the associated flares are also relatively short-lived.  Especially, the duration of the gamma-ray flares is typically quite short, around 10\\u2013100 seconds.  However, some gamma-ray flares are observed to last up to several hours, much longer than the concurrent EUV and X-ray flares.

Recent discovery of a relationship between decameter-hectometric type II radio bursts and SGRE events has provided support for CME-shock as a source of high-energy protons.  The question whether the CME-shock model is a valid description of SGRE events will be investigated by performing statistical analyses of the kinematics and spatial extent of CME-driven shocks and the properties of the associated type II radio bursts and SEP events observed during the SGRE events.  These analyses will be carried out by comparing events that seem to agree well with the CME-shock model with those that do not seem to comply with the model, and by identifying the differences in the circumstances of the eruption and the properties of the associated CMEs and shocks.  The secondary scientific objective is to determine the characteristics of the associated CMEs and SEP events, which could provide observational constraints and parameters for numerical modeling efforts of particle acceleration and transport during SGRE events.

Project leadership will engage with schools and community partners in southwest Georgia, where regional challenges caused by poverty and inequity contribute to minimal production of STEM teachers from the local communities. There is a need to both grow and diversify the STEM teacher pipeline to meet future staffing demands and to improve STEM learning outcomes for underrepresented students. The project addresses this need by developing 12 new STEM teachers and training them to implement an innovative STEM curriculum based on Citizen Science. Such a curriculum involves collecting scientific information from nearby areas and attempting to solve problems that are relevant to the lives of the students and other citizens in those local communities.  The new STEM teachers' training in Citizen Science will link three key teaching skills: (1) use of culturally responsive instruction, (2) connecting new understanding and knowledge to what students already know, and (3) creation of teaching exercises and lessons that interweave concepts from multiple STEM areas during the problem-solving process. Project outcomes will help to identify solutions to one of the most challenging issues facing rural education in America: how to produce adequate numbers of STEM-certified minority teachers who are exceptionally qualified and willing to stay in high-need schools.  The student population at Albany State University is more that 70% African American, resulting in a strong potential for increasing the number of African American STEM teachers in local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at Albany State University includes partnerships with: 1) school districts in Southwest Georgia, specifically Dougherty, Randolph and Terrell; 2) the USDA Research Station (Peanut Lab) in Dawson, GA; and 3) a consortium of non-profit partners including The Albany Civil Rights Institute, Thronateeska Heritage Center, The Flint RiverQuarium, and Chehaw Park. The primary goal of the project is to increase and diversify the STEM teacher pipeline in southwest Georgia school districts. Specific objectives include: (1) train a cohort of diverse STEM teachers to use culturally relevant pedagogy; (2) design curricular modules that are problem based and focus on Citizen Science; (3) provide systematic and ongoing induction support; and (4) develop STEM teacher leaders. During the 5-year project, the project will produce 12 STEM teachers in multiple STEM disciplines (e.g., mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry), and support their transition from STEM post-baccalaureates to highly qualified teachers, and to teacher leaders. Intellectual merit of the project includes contributions to research and practice for building a diverse STEM teacher pipeline and a more STEM literate public. By engaging higher education and its school system partners in Citizen Science, this project intends to encourage teacher education programs to redesign instructional practices and curricula to draw upon the cultural assets of teacher candidates and students they will serve. The project's focus on Citizen Science will link the learning principles of culturally responsive pedagogy, constructivism, and integrative learning.

The breakthroughs needed in the materials for scalable quantum devices requires materials and device scientists and computer architecture engineers to be trained in quantum information. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the University of Washington (UW) will address these needs by training master\\u2019s and doctoral students in an interdisciplinary program in quantum information science and technology (QIST). The traineeship anticipates providing training to one hundred and ninety (190) students including twenty-two (22) funded trainees, by combining disciplines in quantum information (chemistry, physics, applied mathematics, materials science &amp; engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science), interactions with national laboratories and industry partners,  project-based learning on commercially available cloud quantum computers, and hands-on research in QIST. There is a growing national need for US quantum scientists to meet the current workforce demands from US national laboratories and industries (including startups and established companies).

The foundational course is followed by an interdisciplinary project-based course that will utilize classical computer simulations of quantum devices as well as experiments on real quantum devices, provided by industry partners.  These resources will help teach essential concepts in quantum information implementations while solidifying student\\u2019s theoretical understanding of QIST.

Ontologies and terminologies have played a vital role in biomedical research for coding, managing, sharing, and exchange of vast amounts of heterogeneous biomedical data that are being continuously generated, such as in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHRs have been widely used in translational research to learn predictive models for discovery and disease management across varying patient cohorts. The very first step in such EHR-based applications often concerns patient cohort identification. Cohort identification involves the specification of a collection of eligibility criterion that needs to be transformed into a computable representation using the EHR\\u2019s semantic backbone (i.e., coding systems or ontologies) before queries can run against the EHR database. However, there are two critical barriers in performing effective cohort identification from large-scale EHRs. The first one is data (or semantic) heterogeneity, caused by a mixed utilization of coding systems. The second one is the quality of the semantic backbone or ontology hierarchy, which is essential for translating patient eligibility criteria to executable database queries. To address such challenges, this project will develop new methods for ontology matching and for ontology quality enhancement that directly impact data science practice in biomedicine, such as patient cohort identification. In addition, this project will incorporate the proposed computational aspects into data science-based courses to train next generation data scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of three research objectives. In Objective 1, the PI will develop new graph neural network (GNN)-based learning methods for matching biomedical ontologies by harnessing knowledge embedded in sources such as the Unified Medical Language System. This will address the heterogeneity issue and achieve semantic interoperability. In Objective 2, the PI will develop learning-based methods for detecting quality defects in subclass relations. This will address the quality issue and achieve continued enhancement of ontology hierarchies. In Objective 3, the PI will develop an ontology-based COVID-19 query engine for patient cohort identification, which is a real-world application of enhancing semantic interoperability for supporting data-driven COVID-19 research. For evaluation of the proposed methods, domain experts will be involved in validation of the resulted matching concepts and detected quality issues.

To cover a large area with numerous devices, they form multi-hop mesh networks at the expense of energy, cost, and complexity, posing a big challenge to support the scale and wide-area of today\\u2019s IIoT. For example, the East Texas oil-field extends over 74x8 square kilometers requiring tens of thousands of sensors for automated management.

This is distinct from quantum computing that deals with quantum bits (q-bits) which are a superposition of 0 and 1 (and hence a mixture of both 0 and 1 all the time). Quantum computing usually requires the most hardware resources and digital computing the least, with probabilistic computing between the two. Most of the hardware resources in probabilistic computing are devoted to generating specific correlations between two or more p-bit streams.

In this project, an ultra-compact and extremely energy-efficient correlator or anti-correlator will be studied and demonstrated that can generate tunable degrees of anti-correlation between two p-bit streams. The approach is implemented with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) whose soft layers are in close proximity and hence dipole-coupled. Bit states are encoded in the resistance states (high or low) of the MTJs. One MTJ generates a p-bit when driven by a spin-polarized current delivering a spin-transfer-torque. The current sets the resistance state high or low with a probability determined by its magnitude, while the bit state of the other MTJ is determined by dipole coupling with the first. Very strong dipole coupling will result in perfect anti-correlation, while very weak dipole coupling will result in no correlation. The effect of dipole coupling will be controlled by applying (electrically generated) local strain to the second MTJ, which modulates its internal energy barrier, thereby modulating the degree of anti-correlation between the p-bits from 0% to 100%.

By developing a novel laboratory-based experiment that can incorporate different soils in a simulation of the breakdown of different food products over time, the researchers will provide an efficient, region-specific experimental design applicable worldwide, not only for archaeology but for any field (such as food science or sustainability) that requires the study of how food breaks down in soils. Drawing on supercritical fluid extraction, a technique used in renewable energies research, the team will also produce an optimized method for recovering food residues that minimizes the loss of interpretative information about a pot\\u2019s contents. The researchers will also evaluate whether environmental differences pose a challenge to using radiocarbon dating of individual food molecules to link the archaeology of everyday life to a historical timeline. By applying these developments to three case-studies the researchers will produce robust datasets that advance the understanding of past food practices and their entanglement in politics, religion, and the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.107682228088379, \"y\": 5.062529563903809}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Unlocking the secrets of slow slip by drilling at the northern Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand: CORK observatory development and installation\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The Hikurangi subduction zone offshore the eastern North Island of New Zealand has characteristics that provide a globally unique window into a fundamental aspect of how stress builds up and is relieved as an oceanic plate thrusts (or ?subducts?) beneath continental crust. Recently, seismologists have recognized that subduction megathrust faults undergo slip in episodic ?slow slip events?. Prior to the discovery of slow slip events in the last decade, our paradigms of fault slip were focused on seismic slip in major earthquakes. Since the discovery of slow slip, most studies have focused on deep (&gt;20-40 km depth) slow slip events, but we now realize that shallow slow slip events (&lt;5-15 km depth) exist that are much more accessible to near-source investigations. These shallow slow fault slip events are centered beneath the ocean so onshore instruments have not been able to measure how much surface deformation occurs. This study takes advantage of planned International Ocean Discovery Program drilling to install sensors in two boreholes that will measure properties indicative of change in the shallow crust that the episodic fault activity causes.  Senior researchers in borehole instrumentation will mentor mid-early career scientists, passing along extensive knowledge of such complex implementation and research. Japanese, New Zealand, and German collaborators will participate with the US investigators in this international study, and local communities will benefit from scientist outreach associated with cruises off New Zealand. This study is being undertaken as a ?community proposal?, whereby all data will be immediately publicly available.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The shallowest, well-documented slow slip events on Earth occur at the northern Hikurangi margin, offshore Gisborne, New Zealand, at &lt;5-15 km depth. They recur approximately every 1-2 years, with slip on the plate boundary interface of up to 15-20 cm. The unusually close proximity of the Gisborne slow slip events to the seafloor, the large slow slip event magnitudes (equivalent to an earthquake magnitude Mw ~6.3-6.8), and short recurrence intervals makes this the ideal setting for evaluating the near-source hydrological, geochemical, and thermal response of the offshore subduction margin to large, frequent, well-documented deformation transients. The borehole observatory data will clarify the role that fluid pressures, fluid flow, and temperature play in the occurrence of slow slip events, as well as the influence of slow slip event deformation on fluid and geochemical cycling within the forearc. This project will establish the borehole facility and set-up open data access. Analysis of the first two years of data, recovered by ROV, will evaluate the deformation, hydrological, and geochemical responses near the source of slow slip, as well as document the thermal regime of shallow slow slip. One of the borehole installations will target the region surrounding the shallow portion of the megathrust fault , while sensors in a second borehole will target the over-riding plate ~5 km above the slow slip event source.\", \"x\": 8.11324691772461, \"y\": 6.459804534912109}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"SBIR Phase I:  Quieting systemic hyper-inflammation (COVID-19)\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to alleviate the suffering caused by hyper-inflammation.  Hyper-inflammation is a mis-regulation of the immune system often brought on by viral pneumonia. It can have severe life-threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and changes in blood clotting; hyper-inflammation has been seen in COVID-19 patients. Secondary conditions caused by hyper-inflammation can also have severe long-term consequences to patient health. This project will develop therapeutics that quiet the systemic mis-regulation of the immune system and reduce patient mortality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance a treatment for hyper-inflammation, such as that induced by COVID-19. It arises from multiple stimuli and results in life-threatening mis-regulation of the immune system. With a novel molecular target, a new class of anti-fibrotic compounds have the potential to reduce cytokine levels and pro-coagulation factors, acting broadly to address the heterogeneity of inflammation responses. As information becomes available regarding the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19, relevant biomarkers have been proposed.  To demonstrate robust actions on inflammation this project will evaluate the effects of the therapeutic on 1) pro-inflammatory cytokine release, 2) activation of the innate immune system, and 3) systemic concentrations of cytokines and pro-coagulation factors after initiation of inflammation. Biomarkers will be established to track the efficacy of the therapeutic at early and late stages of inflammation, providing a strong rationale for testing the efficacy of this class of compounds in animal models of inflammation.

Valsaraj of Louisiana State University to study micro/nanoplastics. Micro/nanoplastics have become very common in the environment because of the gradual aging and weathering of discarded plastic waste. They can move up the food chain and potentially impact both aquatic and terrestrial species. In order to assess the potential health risks of micro/nanoplastics, it is critical to understand how they interact with an aqueous environment. The team studies the effect of sunlight-induced oxidation and aging of micro/nanoplastics which increases their wettability and ability to disperse in water. This project is exploratory with risk but the knowledge gained helps guide future in-depth studies of the environmental transport and fate of microplastics. The project provides opportunities for graduate students to develop new skills in an emerging field and actively engages undergraduate students from Baton Rouge Community College in the proposed research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project addresses the question: Do micro/nanoplastics exist as micro or nanosized particles or do they aggregate into larger structures? This question is critical because any biological, environmental, and atmospheric impact of the micro/nanoplastics will be governed by their dispersed/aggregated state. Photooxidation processes lead to the formation of hydrophilic chemical functional groups on the surface of a degrading polymer, which increases the water wettability and dispersibility of the micro/nanoplastics. The team investigates the effect of photooxidation and solvent pH/ionic strength on the dispersibility of spherical shaped model micro/nanoplastics made from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. These model plastics are photooxidized under controlled laboratory conditions and characterized for their dispersed state using a combination of small angle scattering, light microscopy, and spectroscopic techniques.

IR thermal imaging also has significant potential in consumer electronics, transportation, medical imaging, and robotic and aerospace industries.  One of the key limitations hindering wide-scale implementation of infrared thermal cameras for consumer markets is the high cost of these imaging systems.  In the current IR thermal imaging systems, the transmissive optical elements (e.g., lenses, windows) require the use of expensive inorganic elements (e.g., germanium).  To address this technology barrier, the goal is to pursue the development of IR optical polymers, which are composed of inexpensive starting materials and can easily be melt or solution processed into windows or lenses. Successfully implementation of these materials as inexpensive IR plastics may enable creation of less expensive IR cameras and the potential for entry of these IR imaging systems in automobiles, housing, and medical imaging sectors.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIPs), which are a new class of synthetic polymers with enhanced optical properties for IR applications.

Some learning mechanisms are fast and flexible, but mentally effortful; others are slow and inflexible, but effortless, learning the value of different choices in different situations. This project investigates the possibility that the mechanisms are not independent. Specifically, the investigators test the hypothesis that effortful processes contribute to identifying what the slow and effortless \\u201creinforcement learning\\u201d processes learn the value of: what features of the situation are relevant, what aspects of the choices matter. In that sense, the simpler reinforcement learning process, usually thought to be automated and instinctive, may be improved by the exertion of cognitive effort such as attention and short term memory, and impaired by a lack thereof. Better understanding the role of cognitive effort in effortless reinforcement learning processes should strengthen our ability to identify sources of learning impairment and optimize learning in the many everyday life situations where we need to learn, be it new software, parenting, or interacting with others in new environments. Better understanding of the mechanisms that support human learning will provide inspiration for improved algorithms for artificial intelligence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning in humans is the result of a carefully orchestrated set of processes interacting in parallel. Some processes, like working memory, rely on executive function to store information in a flexible format that is effortful to maintain and use. Other processes, like reinforcement learning, store information in a less flexible but more robust and virtually effortless format, encoding the value of choices. In this project, the investigators study how executive functions may additionally support reinforcement learning processes. This project uses novel experimental protocols to examine how weakening executive functions affects learning, and apply novel computational models to disentangle the learning processes.  A goal  is to establish a computational architecture to explain how executive function supports reinforcement learning processes. This project will significantly advance our understanding of the computational mechanisms that underly learning in humans. The project will highlight the importance of considering how different processes that contribute to learning interact, and the fact that even learning processes considered to be mostly automated depend on \\u201cintelligent\\u201d executive functions.

To make inspection and reporting objective and consistent, robots such as unmanned aerial vehicles have recently been introduced to perform autonomous surveys of bridges. These robots, equipped with cameras, will rapidly provide a large set of survey data that can be used to aid inspectors in assessing the condition of bridges. To transform these multidisciplinary topics into a new integrated bridge inspection capability, this multi-university team will develop and implement a cooperative robot-inspector system with assistive intelligence (AI) in order to make the future bridge inspection significantly faster, cheaper, safer, and more consistent. A robotic platform equipped with infrared cameras and a central processing unit with intelligent algorithms will operate in both flying and crawling modes, travel in proximity to various parts/elements of a bridge, and collect high-fidelity images of the entire bridge. Inspectors will be instrumented and monitored with a suite of wearable sensors to enable optimal robot-inspector cooperation during each bridge inspection. AI algorithms will be developed in modules to analyze the big data from human sensors and cameras in support of the pre-inspection workforce training, during-inspection element defect detection, and post-inspection condition evaluation of bridges. The robot-inspector-AI system will be integrated and validated at six bridge sites in collaboration with stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary project aims to explore and develop the scientific knowledge and underling methods of AI for a cooperative inspector-robot survey of bridges.

The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record.

Students and community members will be trained during the course of the development of the network, and will learn to address climate challenges common to cold regions.  Long-term outcomes will be used as materials for STEM education and shared with stakeholders who will directly benefit.

During early life, young range in developmental mode across a precocial-altricial spectrum, where precocial species are born mobile and independent whereas altricial species are born helpless. Additionally, young can experience a variety of early life social environments, from small family groups to large communal rearing populations. How do these two factors-developmental mode and early life social complexity-interplay to shape how adults make decisions (cognitive style) and the underlying neuromolecular mechanisms of decision-making? Understanding how the early life social environment and patterns of development shape adult mammalian decision-making is critical to understanding the decisions animals, including humans, make in a complex social world and the shared neural mechanisms governing these processes.

The first objective is to create a large number of functionally relevant proteins with a computer algorithm, which are subject to systematic screening and selection. The second objective is to assess the selected pool of candidate proteins in a 3D model tissue including healthy and infarct conditions, where the model tissue is 3D bio-printed with another computer algorithm to minimize experimental trials and effort.

Thus, the new approach proposed in the CAREER award is to utilize publicly available data to build machine learning models to screen and select those chimeras, which will be built upon a Gaussian Process to derive a posterior from a prior and observations. To avoid the overfitting problem of machine learning with the relatively smaller number of publicly available data, an additional machine learning model will be built with 1) protein folding metrics and 2) intracellular protein-based assay. To assess the performance of designer ECM proteins, an in vitro model of infarct (border zone) will be fabricated with 3D bio-printing. To recapitulate complex features of the border zone with minimal numbers of trials of 3D bio-printing, Bayesian Optimization will be applied to balance the exploration of the overall search space and the exploitation of the local search space to effectively achieve the optimal 3D bio-printing and biomaterial parameters.

The project will develop, benchmark and disseminate tools that perform deep mutational scanning of every CoV2 protein entirely in silico. A computational analysis of sequence, structure and function across the Coronavirus family will yield the discovery of functional epitopes across the CoV2 proteome and on weighing the functional impact of new mutations in emerging CoV2 strains. The outcome will be to comprehensively map all actionable targets in CoV2 that may then serve, for example, as antigens for pan-Coronavirus vaccines or as docking sites for repurposed drugs. A machine learning search for human host genetic factors that may distinguish between asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 infections from severe to lethal infections will help identify and disseminate human host biomarkers of mortality that personalize preventive measures and treatment modalities, tailored to individual genetic risks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project applies an Evolutionary Action theory that takes an integrative mathematical physics approach to the couplings between sequence variations, protein structure-function and evolutionary divergences. This approach involves computing the evolutionary forces that shaped fitness landscapes, and assessing the energy expended by mutations against these forces as they traverse these landscapes. While most natural mutations exert low energy and little or no impact on function or evolution, a few mutations carry significant energy and reliably change function and fitness. Preliminary data, including on SARS-CoV-2, show that this approach will yield precise and tunable maps of protein functional epitopes and accurate scores of the impact of mutations on function. As a training feature, it will provide a singularly accurate measure of the functional impact of each mutation for machine learning to find which genes are diferentially affected in a group of carriers of a complex phenotype vs a control group.  Because EA is based on fundamental principles of evolution and protein structure-function, it is entirely general and the computational techniques we propose can be deployed to study any virus, bacterium, or eukaryotic system and their interactions.

Previous scholarship has generally described this process in two ways, assuming that hunter-gatherer communities survived through either: 1.) Isolation from farmers and herders across frontier boundaries; or 2.) Symbiosis with neighboring food-producing communities as ritual specialists and producers of wild resources. In the latter scenario, it is assumed that close relationships between these groups often led to the gradual assimilation of hunter-gatherers and the loss of generalized hunting and gathering of diverse resources as a viable way of life as governance and economic systems became more dependent on specialized production. Archaeology is well placed to provide new information about long-term relationships between hunter-gatherers, farmers, and herders in order to address the project\\u2019s key questions: What led to the survival of hunting and gathering groups into the present? What role does the use and exchange of natural resources play in the formation of political and economic systems capable of withstanding changing social and environmental conditions? This research is relevant to contemporary challenges, such as the nature of resilient economic systems or concerns about flexible responses to food security.

There are several ways that this might happen. Carbon dioxide could be released when the total amount of algae in ocean waters decreases after the last ice age. Or the amount of carbon dioxide stored in the deeper ocean waters could change with differing pathways of deep currents.  Recent work suggest the Indian Ocean might play an important role in one or both of these processes. Newly collected sediment cores collected from the Indian Ocean will be examined for subtle changes in the chemistry that will provide scientists a way to document how carbon dioxide moves between the oceans and atmosphere over long periods of time.

During glaciations, changes in thermohaline circulation, Southern Ocean ventilation, and nutrient utilization are all believed to have played an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2. An improved understanding of the different roles of biological transfer versus physical transfer of CO2 requires examining multiple water masses in multiple ocean basins. The scientific objective is to reconstruct the magnitude and mechanisms driving carbon storage in the southern Indian Ocean by determining the temporal evolution and vertical distribution of Delta14C and oxygenation (using quantitative proxies: Delta-delta13Cwuel-globo, and alkenone preservation) in Indian Ocean interior water masses across the last glacial-interglacial transition. These proxies have been chosen to distinguish between the rate of water mass circulation and respiration-driven CO2 accumulation to assess the roles these mechanisms played in CO2 sequestration. The use of multiple sediment cores across latitude and longitude has been fundamental in determining that critical indicators of oceanic CO2 storage (Delta14C and oxygenation) differed substantially in the Atlantic and Pacific through time. Work proposed here will fill a substantial gap in our knowledge by making use of the first new core material from the Southern Indian Ocean in nearly 30 years.

Their increasing concentration of people, buildings, and infrastructures increases their vulnerability to earthquakes. The application of seismic building codes reduces the risk for populations. Yet, establishing and applying these codes at a city scale is not trivial. It requires a local understanding of how strongly the ground may shake during future events. Unfortunately, the available data to inform such an understanding are often scarce. This is because of the difficulty to deploy a dense network of seismic instruments in urban environment. Here, the researchers test and further develop a new technology, called Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS).  DAS turns the fiber-optic cables running through every city into a dense network of seismic sensors. By injecting laser pulses at one end of a cable and analyzing the backscattered light, one can measure the shaking of the cable and that of the ground around it. The team uses a DAS network on Stanford University campus to improve the extraction of seismic measurements from fiber-optic cables. The new methods are then tested at large scale in Mexico City, which faces extreme seismic hazards. The project has strong implications for risks assessment and mitigation in cities around the world. It fosters international collaboration with Mexico.

Correspondingly, communication complexity---which studies the possibilities and limitations of such protocols---is important to foundational research in computer science.  In fact, the influence of communication complexity runs much deeper, because the operation of an algorithm can itself be seen as a careful orchestration of information flow from input bits to output bits, which gives rise to a communication protocol between abstract entities. Key questions in communication complexity are: how much efficiency is gained by allowing the communicating parties to (a) use randomized strategies that may err with some small probability, or (b) use a complex pattern of interactive communication as opposed to a simple one?

This means that the engineers must know the behavior of materials that are used in these structures accurately. Damage and failure in materials start at the atomic scale and propagate through the structural length scales to manifest itself. Therefore, it is important to be able to predict material response through multiple scales based on experimental observations and computational modeling. Much effort has been put towards achieving this capability but the immense amount of information that is obtained from advanced experimental techniques and physics-based numerical simulations has proven intractable. This award aims to transform the current practices in the field of mechanics of materials by introducing machine learning to optimize the extraction and fusion of information and knowledge from the disparate and expansive experimental and numerical datasets. The goal is to dramatically improve the efficiency and output compared to the current protocols of material behavior prediction, which will also accelerate the materials discovery process. It is expected that theses outcomes will provide significant competitive advantages to the US industry in a broad range of advanced materials technology areas, including those related to healthcare, energy, and national security. The award will also be a vehicle to train graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of materials science, mechanics of materials, and data and information sciences. The research outcomes and developed tools will be transferred into commercial practice through multiple industrial collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to accomplish the research objective described above by developing and deploying a novel Bayesian machine learning framework that is centered on systematically uncovering the physics controlling the multiscale materials phenomena of interest. The overall strategy involves establishing suitable high-fidelity reduced-order (i.e., surrogate) models to capture the localization tensors for elastic and plastic deformations in multiphase polycrystalline microstructures. In turn, these models will be used to formulate a computationally efficient strategy for Bayesian sequential design of experiments that identifies the most optimal experiments offering the highest potential for information (or knowledge) gain. As a result, several high-throughput experimental assays will be designed and evaluated to critically examine their value for reliably calibrating the unknown material parameters in sophisticated plasticity theories. Based on the results of these investigations, novel high-throughput protocols will be designed and implemented to demonstrate the significant cost and time savings achieved in the multiscale characterization of the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous structural materials. Specifically, the new protocols will be validated using samples of polycrystalline dual-phase steels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.701279640197754, \"y\": 8.051553726196289}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"EAGER: QAC: QCH: Holographic Quantum Algorithms for Simulating Many-Body Systems\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Accurately modeling materials is essential for guiding materials discovery and designing advanced electronic devices.

While a promising approach, there is a large gap in size and accuracy between quantum computers that can be built with current technology and those needed to make progress on real-world relevant materials challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To close this gap, this project will develop quantum software and hardware prototypes in which quantum computations are performed on efficiently compressed quantum data, to dramatically reduce the resources required to simulate large-scale material models.

This compression is achieved by an algorithm that alternates between coherent entangling gates and measurement of a selected subset of qubits. This approach represents a dramatic departure from conventional quantum algorithmic frameworks and will require a fundamental rethinking of quantum algorithm and hardware design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will conduct research to establish a basic theoretical and experimental proof-of-principle for holographic simulation techniques. Advanced holographic simulation techniques will be developed to treat electronic materials, 2d and 3d models, and compute non-equilibrium electronic and thermal transport and optical spectra relevant for real-world devices. The fundamental capabilities and limitations of holographic representations of quantum states will be rigorously characterized. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project team will fabricate a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) testbed in which a two-level superconducting qubit controls a multi-level superconducting cavity mode. The multi-level cavity mode provides a larger quantum memory than a conventional two-level qubit, and the hybrid qubit/cavity system provides powerful methods to create quantum entanglement. Together, these advantages will enable simulation of more complex material states with the same number of quantum devices compared to conventional qubit-only systems.

Many engineering programs emphasize the economic opportunities that engineering degrees will open to graduates, such as working for the private sector.  However, engineering students are increasingly interested in ways to use their engineering education to pursue careers in which they can see the human impact of their work. The premise of this project is that opportunities for civic engagement can improve student engagement in engineering education.  These opportunities require students to learn new approaches and skills that are not typically taught in the engineering curriculum, such as human centered design and problem solving with empathy. By helping students develop these skills, students will be better positioned to use their engineering knowledge in the future to benefit society. The project will test the hypothesis that mentoring, oriented towards civic engagement and addressing societal challenges, will enhance the engagement of undergraduate engineering students in STEM learning. This project expects to enhance students\\u2019 learning experiences and provide opportunities to strengthen communities, while simultaneously encouraging students\\u2019 development of civic responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the goal of improving engineering education through the cultivation of innovative civic engagement, this project will:  (i) develop, implement, and evaluate a pedagogical intervention that engages students in service learning projects; (ii) assess the effectiveness of the intervention in supporting student learning with respect to engagement in their engineering program and capacity for innovation; and (iii) refine a theoretical model of how the intervention helps students develop civic responsibility.

This prevents the effective imaging, diagnosis and treatment of deadly brain-related diseases such as Alzheimer\\u2019s, Parkinson\\u2019s disease and brain cancer. As such, there is a tremendous demand for delivery systems which can solve these problems and effectively treat brain disease. Natural materials such as ferritin proteins have been shown to self-assemble into nanocages and cross the blood-brain barrier. However, a complete understanding of how these nanocages move across the barrier into the brain as well as their structure-function relationships has remained elusive. This research project will combine bioengineering and chemical approaches to understand how these nanostructures interact with the blood-brain barrier and to  rationally design nanocages which have the capability to cross blood-brain barriers and to achieve cellular delivery. The project will provide a robust nanoparticle tool to study nanomaterial-biological barrier interactions and will advance the science for the development of next generation brain drug delivery and imaging platforms and techniques. This project brings together several key technology areas, including nanomaterials, chemical engineering, cell biology and biomedical engineering, providing interdisciplinary training for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students as well as exposing students from local high schools to cutting-edge research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of the research project is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of protein based nanocage/blood-brain barrier interactions using ferritin as a model protein and subsequently to use this knowledge to develop a novel family of protein nanocages as brain targeted, modular delivery platforms with additional functionalities available on demand. The central hypothesis is that with rational design, the engineered ferritin protein can maintain its ability to assemble into nanocages, cross the biological interface of the blood-brain barrier, and also be conferred with new abilities for targeted delivery, loading of therapeutics and/or imaging agents. The research project seeks to: 1) design and genetically introduce targeting domains to ferritin proteins, assemble the ferritin proteins into ferritin nanocages, 2) investigate the nanocages\\u2019 blood-brain barrier traversing and cellular targeting capabilities using cellular models; and 3) study the nanocage structure-biological function relationship.

As the DNA in a single human cell is approximately 6 feet long, it must be packaged into physical units termed chromosomes. Every time a cell divides, these chromosomes must be duplicated and faithfully distributed to each new cell. Over the course of a lifetime in humans, this must occur trillions of times. To facilitate this, mammalian cells form a molecular machine \\u2013 called the \\u201ckinetochore\\u201d - that recognizes each chromosome and physically segregates these chromosomes to the newly formed cells. When this distribution machinery is defective, critical genetic material can be lost or disrupted, with serious consequences to the function and viability of those cells. Thus, it is critical to understand how kinetochores assemble and function. However, there are substantial open questions regarding the nature, function, and evolution of kinetochores. This project will explore the changes to the kinetochore machine across mammals and use evolutionary differences to create a new understanding of the way in which this machine functions and adapts to differing requirements.  The Broader Impacts of the project will include the training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, along with a high-school teacher in research methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eukaryotic chromosome segregation requires the kinetochore, the macromolecular structure that connects chromosomes to the microtubule polymers, which power their movement. Despite a conserved requirement in directing chromosome segregation, the kinetochore is remarkably flexible in its structure, composition, and organization across eukaryotes. This project will harness kinetochore evolutionary plasticity to probe the molecular logic by which kinetochores assemble and function. In particular, this project will test whether changes to kinetochore protein sequences, composition, and requirements across mammalian species represent evolutionary-driven mechanisms that optimize fundamentally similar kinetochore activities to meet diverse physiological constraints. By exploring this idea, this research seeks to generate a coherent molecular model for how kinetochore components act individually and in an integrated manner to achieve faithful chromosome segregation in a way that is robust and conserved, and yet tailored to the specific requirements of each species. Together, this project will define the logic of kinetochore wiring, reveal the composition of the critical kinetochore scaffold, the properties of the kinetochore-microtubule interface, and how these are modulated across evolution to achieve an optimal outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.333533763885498, \"y\": 6.135215759277344}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Data-Driven Situational Awareness for Resilient Operation of Distribution Networks with Inverter-based distributed energy resources\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"With the increasing importance of clean, affordable, reliable, and resilient electricity networks, large scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar generations, and battery storages, has been considered and implemented in distribution networks.

With such devices, a quantum simulator, a special-purpose quantum computer, may be able to solve problems that cannot be solved with classical computers. A prerequisite to implementing quantum simulation is to prepare the simulator in an appropriate many-body ground state, something that could also benefit the solution of combinatorial optimization problems.

Efficient preparation of a many-body system in its ground state is a prerequisite for exploring quantum dynamics and many-body correlations in quantum simulators. Understanding the feasibility and limits on state preparation also benefits the study of combinatorial optimization problems in adiabatic quantum computing. Despite previous efforts, it remains a challenging question to prepare many-body states with high fidelity due to the lack of knowledge of the energy spectrum, the rapid decrease of energy gaps with the size of the quantum simulator, and the limited decoherence times in practical devices.  The PI aims to develop a universal and implementable algorithm to efficiently and accurately generate many-body ground states by coupling a quantum simulator to an auxiliary system that induces nonlinearity. This novel approach exploits the unique dynamics in the vicinity of bifurcation points, which is a generic property in nonlinear systems, to enable self-governed adiabatic evolution with significantly suppressed diabatic transitions.

Hence, this project will help illuminate the role of ag-marsh landscapes as corridors for inland marsh migration in response to sea-level rise. Field observations of in-channel and overmarsh flows, and modern and historic sedimentation rates will be evaluated in the context of marsh topography, drainage structure, hydraulic connectivity and vegetation effects.

The A+ upgrade and all 3rd generation detector designs depend on the development of mirrors with low coating thermal noise. The coating thermal noise is reduced, primarily, by lowering the mechanical (elastic) loss of the mirror materials. The core research focus of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) Center for Coatings Research (CCR) is the development of mirror coatings with low mechanical and optical losses for use in A+ and 3rd generation detectors. The research mission of the CCR includes: understanding and reducing mechanical loss in amorphous metal-oxides, the most widely-used materials in mirror coatings; and developing and testing crystalline (AlGaAs) coatings, which have demonstrated low losses for small mirrors.

Since that first discovery much progress has been made in reducing quantum noise and the coupling from seismic, scatter and jitter noise, leaving coating thermal noise as the dominant barrier limiting gravitational-wave astronomy in the most sensitive observation band. Reducing this noise source for future generations of detectors requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses, and forms the main goal of the CCR. The CCR combines groups working on computational modeling, coating deposition, and characterization of atomic structure and macroscopic material properties. These components are often performed by four diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these communities focused on a unified research goal. In its first two years of operation, research in the CCR has identified different structural motifs associated with room-temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, which led to synthesis of germania (GeO2) films giving rise to the lowest-loss amorphous oxide film other than silica. Going forward, this structural guide will serve as a paradigm informing the development of high-refractive index amorphous coatings with lower elastic loss. In addition, thermo-optically-optimized AlGaAs crystalline coatings have demonstrated a coating thermal noise well below the requirements for A+, and the CCR has generated a development schedule to scale up these coatings to LIGO mirror sizes and will continue investigations into these materials.

The approach has the ability to identify, almost instantly and with high precision, anomalous behaviors indicative of possibly hazardous situations with either a known signature or never encountered during pre-deployment testing. The goal of this project is to have a prototype demonstrating its readiness for transition to practice and eventual deployment. Three types of threats are tackled: (1) Deliberate intrusions employing zero-day attacks and sophisticated evasion techniques; (2) Insider threats: abuse of privileges by insiders with or without spoofing of user identities; (3) Anomalous behaviors never encountered during pre-deployment testing of safety-critical systems and possibly indicative of malfunctioning. These anomalies include accidental or inadvertent failures due to bugs as well as physical side channel attacks that gives rise to execution of emergency actions. Anomalies in many safety-critical cyber-physical systems are particularly dangerous. For example, attacks against a car such as antilock-braking system (ABS) sensor spoofing, wireless command injection, and engine control unit (ECU) infiltration have been demonstrated, leading ultimately to a car crash or significant drift off the road. The importance of the research cannot be overstated when it comes to safety-critical and mission-critical cyber-physical systems that are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning for decision making, situational awareness, and general reasoning. The explainability conundrum of deep learning algorithms and models coupled with the need to certify the overall system for safety and security points to the criticality of imposing continuous checks on these two criteria (safety and security) during operation to safeguard not only against unanticipated behavior but also the potential bugs and failures in system hardware including sensors/actuators. The research will create a framework allowing cyber-physical systems to be certified for safety and security through the ability to detect and diagnose unsafe and insecure anomalous situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research combines a scalable Runtime Verification (RV) framework intended for embedded systems and a Paraminer specification mining tool for Anomaly Detection (AD). A critical feature in this RV+AD approach is the ability to monitor properties using not only traces relevant to CPU execution, but also other system components such as memories, buses, sensors, and actuators. This observability across both the cyber and physical states adds significant capabilities to deal with physical side channel attacks which are extremely hard to detect or thwart. This can be achieved by correlating traces from both program execution on the CPU(s) and sensor data. In a power side channel attack, for example, the current sensor data can be correlated with execution of critical advanced encryption standard (AES) encryption algorithms running on the CPU to detect periods of potential vulnerability, and engage obfuscation measures to thwart such attacks.

The goal is to identify the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. The new physics, or new forces, can be manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, whose presence would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries of hadrons containing the b and c quarks, allowing new phenomena to be observed indirectly - or via direct observation of new force-carrying particles. The data sets collected by the LHC experiments are some of the largest in the world. For example, the sensor arrays of the LHCb experiment, in which both PIs participate, produce about 100 TB/s and close to a zettabyte per year. Even after drastic data-reduction performed by custom-built read-out electronics, the data volume is still about 10 exabytes per year. Such large data sets cannot be stored indefinitely; therefore, all high energy physics (HEP) experiments employ a second data-reduction scheme executed in real time by a data-ingestion system - referred to as a trigger system in HEP - to decide whether each event is to be persisted for future analysis or permanently discarded. The primary goal of this project is developing and deploying software that will maximize the performance of the LHCb trigger system - running its first processing stage on GPUs - so that the full physics discovery potential of LHCb is realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LHCb detector is being upgraded for Run 3 (which will start to record data in 2022), when the trigger system will need to process 25 exabytes per year. Currently, only 0.3 of the 10 exabytes per year processed by the trigger is analyzed using high-level computing algorithms; the rest is discarded prior to this stage using simple algorithms executed on FPGAs. To significantly extend its physics reach in Run 3, LHCb plans to process the entire 25 exabytes each year using high-level computing algorithms. The PIs propose running the entire first trigger-processing stage on GPUs, which has zero (likely negative) net cost, and frees up all of the CPU resources for the second processing stage. The LHCb trigger makes heavy use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, which will need to be reoptimized both for Run 3 conditions but also for usage on GPUs. The specific objectives of this proposal are developing: GPU-based versions of the primary trigger-selection algorithms, which make heavy usage of ML; GPU-based calorimeter-clustering and electron-identification algorithms, likely using ML; and the infrastructure required to deploy ML algorithms within the GPU-based trigger framework. These advances will make it possible to explore many potential explanations for dark matter, e.g., dark photon decays, and the matter/anti-matter asymmetry of our universe using data that would be otherwise inaccessible due to trigger-system limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.993325233459473, \"y\": 8.601044654846191}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"SBIR Phase I: Space Object Tracking Unit\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable sustainable growth of the space ecosystem by making transparency, accountability, and predictability easy and simple for space asset operators and owners.

Planning for future sea level rise in the US is critical for national security, public health, and socioeconomic stability. However, current predictions of sea level rise remain uncertain, because the future behavior of melting ice sheets - a primary cause of sea level rise - is not well understood. A recent United Nations report (IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate) summarized two startling facts: (i) Recent sea level rise acceleration is due to increased ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; and (ii) Uncertainty related to ice-sheet instability arises from limited observations, incomplete representation of ice-sheet processes in current models, and evolving understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean and ice sheets. Improving our ability to forecast the health of ice sheets and hence, predictions of future sea level rise, requires a large, long-lasting collective effort among ice sheet scientists working closely with scientists from the modeling and remote sensing disciplines. One challenge in this collective effort is the range of disciplines and approaches to ice-sheet science - the degree of specialization is an obstacle to efficient collaborative work. This project will lower the barriers among sub-disciplines in ice-sheet science by creating and promoting a centralized web-based hub, called \\u201cGhub,\\u201d where datasets and tools will be made accessible to the full range of ice sheet science fields of study. Ghub is accessible to all interested scientists and lay personnel. Use of Ghub includes access to datasets, analysis tools, and cloud computing power, as well as the ability to develop and share new tools within the Ghub environment. Several avenues of outreach and education as part of the Ghub project are specifically aimed at framing ice-sheet science for general audiences, and including students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The urgency in reducing uncertainties of near-term sea level rise relies on improved modeling of ice-sheet response to climate change. Predicting future ice-sheet change requires a tremendous effort across a range of disciplines in ice-sheet science including expertise in observational data, paleoglaciology (\\\"paleo\\\") data, numerical ice sheet modeling, and widespread use of emerging methodologies for learning from the data, such as machine learning. However, significant knowledge and disciplinary barriers make collaboration between data and model groups the exception rather than the norm. Most modeling groups write their own tools to ingest data and analyze output, newer and larger observational datasets are not being fully taken advantage of by the modeling community, and paleo data critical for constraining model representation of ice sheet history are largely inaccessible to modelers. The diverse disciplinary approaches to ice-sheet science has led to bottlenecks that slow the response to the developing crisis. Coordination between data generators and modelers is critical for testing data-driven hypotheses, providing mechanistic explanations for past ice-sheet change, and incorporating newly understood physical processes and validating models to improve their predictive ability. Solving the urgent problem of unoptimized collaboration requires a novel, integrated, trans-disciplinary program that lowers barriers across the distinct approaches to ice-sheet science. Fostering collaboration between disciplines will lead to a transformational leap in ice-sheet and sea-level science. To make the leap, we must improve the efficiency in collaboration among traditionally disparate approaches to the problem. We will develop a community-building scientific and educational cyberinfrastructure framework including models and data processing tools, to enable coordination and synergistic exchange between ice-sheet scientific communities. The new cyberinfrastructure will be a significant bridge that connects the numerical ice-sheet modeling community with rapidly growing observational datasets of past and present ice-sheet states that will ultimately improve predictions of sea level rise. The GHub cyberinfrastructure will also be a template for organizing disparate scientific communities to address urgent societal needs in a timely fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 8.016464233398438, \"y\": 5.696065902709961}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Dynamical Tides in Close Stellar Binaries and Exoplanetary Systems\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Tides are an important factor in many astrophysical settings.

Fluid dynamics is the science of how gases and liquids flow, and a nonlinear system is one in which the change in the output has a complicated (not simply linear) mathematical relationship with a change in the input.  The principal investigators (PIs) have developed the basic theory and computational methods to study both weakly and strongly nonlinear tidal fluid dynamics.  The proposed calculations will advance the state of the art in order to provide physics-based prescriptions for tidal friction over a range of stellar types, evolutionary stages, and degree of nonlinearity of the tide. The detailed calculations and numerical simulations will be distilled into simple prescriptions which may be useful for future investigations by astrophysicists.  The MIT PI will serve as a research mentor in the study of tides to a student each year in the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP).

This project will address the following research questions: 1) Do students exposed to situated learning develop a more comprehensive understanding of energy management, integrated power system analysis, and data analytics that is relevant for emerging challenges in power systems? and 2) Do they take greater account of context and community? To answer these questions, student learning will be measured using pre- and post-tests for the modules. Formative assessment using a situated learning survey and student interviews will be used to improve the modules. A workshop will be held to disseminate project results to the power engineering education community.

The objective of this research is to discover mitigation strategies by leveraging existing and ongoing large data sets from multi-player games to provide a longitudinal window on the net effect of these changes on socialization, support, community, physical and mental health. Are those changes different as new cohorts come online, and how do the dynamics also shift as these new groups mix with the previous ones? Are online games a balm against this growing crisis, or part of the problem? Answers will have broad and potentially immediate impact on the social and psychological health of the very large numbers of people for whom such games are a major platform for friendship and socialization, both veteran players whose real-life situations have changed and new cohorts of players who may bring new needs and behavioral problems to this very significant social medium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the pandemic the research team had already begun to collect very extensive anonymized data through collaboration with the corporation managing a highly popular team-based game, thus having good comparison statistics to analyze the effect of the pandemic over time through constant collection of new data.

Understanding of the deeper meaning of the pandemic will be derived from a questionnaire and interviews administered to representative samples of players, and also through analysis of the in-game text chat.

The problem is that a good amount of this linear program text describes geometric relationships among different pieces of the program's problem domain, say a piece of a map or a tabular arrangement of information. No effort on the part of a software developer can ever express such relationships in a textual way that makes them easy to decipher.

Using this mechanism, developers can create mini GUIs for specific problem domains such as, for example, two-dimension tables of conditional actions. Other developers add instances of these mini-GUIs to their code and interact with them to enter specific details. When the code is supposed to be run, the translator collaborates with these visual elements to render them as ordinary instructions.

Who receives what information? And in what ways do social media amplify or dampen informational inequalities? The project will build a real-time monitor of information consumption regarding the corona virus, drawn largely from Twitter. Specifically, the project will: (1)  build a real time monitor of information regarding the corona virus that would be made available to state and local officials; and (2) evaluate how a medium such as Twitter amplifies/dampens existing informational inequalities around socioeconomic status.  The project will focus on identification of misinformation (e.g., ersatz cures) that pose health risks. The project will supply aggregate information to relevant state and local officials regarding the type and quality of information regarding corona virus circulating in their communities, thus informing interventions that public officials can make to combat that misinformation.

However, this success comes at a prohibitive cost: to obtain better ML models, larger and larger NNs need to be trained and deployed. This is a problem for mobile ML applications, where model training and inference need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computation-/communication-light, and energy-limited platform. Such applications must run on handheld devices or drones and edge infrastructure and introduce new challenges: the heterogeneity of edge networks, the unreliability of the mobile devices, the computational and energy restrictions on such devices, and the communication bottlenecks in wireless networks. This project will address these challenges by investigating a new paradigm for computation- and communication-light, energy-limited distributed NN learning. Success in this project will produce fundamental ideas and tools that will make mobile distributed learning practical. Further, the project will generate courses and open-education resources that can attract diverse groups of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific idea investigated is a new class of distributed NN training algorithms, called independent subnetwork training (IST). IST decomposes a NN into a set of independent subnetworks. Each of those subnetworks is trained at a different device, for one or more backpropagation steps, before a synchronization step. Updated subnetworks are sent from edge-devices to the parameter server for reassembly into the original NN, before the next round of decomposition and local training. Because the subnetworks share no parameters, synchronization requires no aggregation\\u2014it is just an exchange of parameters. Moreover, each of the subnetworks is a fully operational classifier by itself; no synchronization pipelines between subnetworks are required. Key benefits of the proposed IST are that: i) IST assigns fewer training parameters to each mobile node per iteration, significantly reducing the communication overhead, and ii) each device trains a much smaller model, resulting in less computational costs and better energy consumption. Thus, there is good reason to expect that IST will scale much better than classic training algorithms for mobile applications. The project will investigate how to incorporate/extend IST to various NN architectures, develop new theories that explain the efficiency of IST, and unify theory with practice by proposing hardware-level system implementations that scale up and out for mobile applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.341231346130371, \"y\": 9.386048316955566}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Hurricane Sedimentation on Salt Marshes: Extent, Provenance, and Processes\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Salt marshes represent the interface between land and sea and are a vitally important ecosystem that protects the mainland from storms while providing a multitude of valuable services including nursery grounds for fish and shellfish, filtering land-derived wastes, and exporting nutrients and food sources to the coastal ocean. However, platform marshes are now endangered due to accelerating sea-level rise and diminished sediment supplies, which together may lead to their drowning. This project will study how major storms help the sustainability of marshes by transferring sediment from the coastal zone and depositing it in a widespread layer on top of the marsh. This sediment layer (an inch or more) helps the marsh to accrete vertically, fertilizes the marsh with nutrients, and enhances the productivity of the salt marsh grasses. This research will produce an understanding of how storms source these sediments and how characteristics of the nearshore and marsh system influence the direction of floodwaters and the resulting distribution and deposition of the suspended sediment. As a broader impacts activity, the investigators will design and facilitate a graduate-level course on the Interaction of Storms with the Coastline, covering aspects of hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics, geomorphology, ecology, human geography, and economics as they relate to storm impacts. Additional broader impacts include: 1) fostering new and existing relationships with local stakeholders (including the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research site) to facilitate data exchange, cultivate collaboration, and disseminate findings, 2) maintaining a project website presenting details of the motivation, progress, the graduate course, and providing links to data products; 3) training one postdoctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student, and at least two undergraduate students and two high school interns; and 4) direct outreach to the public through development of hands-on K-12 learning activities to be implemented at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study leverages a suite of sediment cores and marsh surface samples collected behind Sapelo Island, Georgia, in December 2017 to quantify the provenance of sediment deposits associated with Hurricane Irma (supported by a RAPID grant from the NSF Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program).

ESMs include the dynamics of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, ice, and vegetation. They can be used to make predictions of use to the public and policymakers. Today\\u2019s ESMs use coarse grids with cells about 100 km wide. Important weather systems like thunderstorms are too small to be simulated with such grids. One way to improve ESMs is to use finer grids that can directly simulate thunderstorms, but such models can only be run on very powerful computers. This project, called EarthWorks, will create an ESM capable of resolving storms by taking advantage of recent developments in high performance computing. EarthWorks will also use artificial intelligence to improve and speed up the model, and state-of-the-art methods to limit the amount of data produced as the model runs. The EarthWorks ESM will be built by spinning off and modifying a copy of the most recent version of the widely used Community Earth System Model. The modified model will represent the atmosphere, the oceans, and the land surface on a single very high-resolution grid, with grid cells about 4 km wide. It will have improved forecast skill, and produce more realistic simulations of past, present, and future climates. The project will make the model and its output openly available for use by all scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The open-source Community Earth System Model (CESM) is both developed and applied to scientific problems by a large community of researchers. It is critical infrastructure for the U.S. climate research community. In the atmosphere and ocean components of the CESM, the adiabatic terms of the partial differential equations that express conservation of mass, momentum, and thermodynamic energy are solved numerically using what is called a dynamical core. Atmosphere and ocean models also include parametric representations, called parameterizations, that are designed to include the effects of storm and cloud processes that occur on scales too small to be represented on the model's grid. Despite decades of work by many scientists, today's parameterizations are still problematic and limit the utility of ESMs for many applications of societal relevance. Fortunately, recent advances in computer power have made it possible to parameterize less, by using grid spacings on the order of a few kilometers over the entire globe. These \\\"global storm-resolving models\\\" (GSRMs) can only be run on today's fastest computers. GSRMs are under very active development at a dozen or so modeling centers around the world. Unfortunately,  however, the current formulation of the CESM prevents it from being run as a GSRM. This project, called EarthWorks, will create a new, openly available GSRM by spinning off and intensively modifying a copy of the CESM. To accomplish this goal, the researchers will use recently developed and closely related dynamical cores for the atmosphere and ocean. All components of the model will use the same very high-resolution grid. This high resolution will make it possible to eliminate the particularly troublesome parameterization of deep cumulus convection (i.e., thunderstorms), and thereby reduce systematic biases that plague current ESMs. Earthworks will exploit the pre-exascale and exascale technologies now being brought to market by high performance computing vendors. The new exascale ESM will run the most computationally intensive components on powerful graphics processor units (GPUs), and exploit node-level task parallelism to execute the rest of the model asynchronously. The component model codes are close to completion and are currently being tested on GPUs. EarthWorks will use a simplified component-coupling approach, incorporate machine learning where feasible, and leverage lossy compression techniques and parallel I/O tools to deal with the enormous data volumes that will be generated as the model runs.

The ability to image, track, and analyze single molecules with microscopes that use light opens up a vast array of new scientific possibilities. One promising area of research for probing single molecules is called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In these experiments, laser light is used to energize minuscule metal particles. These metal nanoparticles can then transfer energy to nearby molecules, resulting in their emission of light at specific energies. As a result, the molecules can be identified. However, many single-molecule experiments show large and random high-speed fluctuations in the amount of emitted light, which are not easily understood and also complicate analysis. This project sets out to develop a new microscope and detector system that can record super-high-resolution movies at a million frames per second, which is fast enough to capture, locate, track, and identify the fleeting signals from individual molecules. By using SERS, this new measurement technology has the potential to reveal more fully how light and matter interact on the nanoscale. This research is being performed at an undergraduate institution and its activities are deeply integrated into the curriculum through open-ended lab projects, summer research opportunities, and public outreach activities. The project aims to inspire, motivate, and train undergraduates for future careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of optical \\\"hotspots\\\" in laser-illuminated metallic nanoparticles is central to the interpretation of the SERS effect. However, while hotspots are generally portrayed as a static feature of a metal/molecule system, single-molecule SERS is punctuated with very high-speed (microsecond) fluctuations, both in signal intensity and spectral content. These random fluctuations originate from different areas of a single nanoparticle and can be uniquely activated with different laser wavelengths. Temperature and laser power also play a role in the fluctuation dynamics. High-speed SERS fluctuations are therefore interpreted to arise from single molecules interacting with a dynamic and restructuring metallic surface that generates short-lived, atomic-scale optical hotspots. Atomic-scale optical hotspots are a relatively uncharted area of basic research and new measurement technologies are therefore needed. This research uses image intensifiers integrated with multiple lasers, detectors, and fast single-photon counters to analyze atomic-scale optical hotspots and single-molecule SERS with unprecedented speed, sensitivity, and resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.424488544464111, \"y\": 8.230578422546387}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Using bidirectional shear protocols to determine microstructural changes responsible for thickening and dethickening in colloidal suspensions\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Shear-thickening fluids have viscosities that increase during vigorous flows.  This property enables many fascinating natural and industrial phenomena ranging from people walking across pools filled with cornstarch in water mixtures, to the processing properties of concrete. Recent studies have started to define the mechanism of shear thickening in particle suspensions. These studies have shown that formation of contacts between the suspended particles acts to build a force-supporting network of interacting particles that aligns with the flows. Previous work has shown that when jostled perpendicularly to the flow direction these networks can in some cases be broken apart allowing for complete dethickening of the suspension. This project will determine if this dethickening approach depends on the density of the suspension. New experiments, simulations, and theory will be used to determine the equations governing this phenomenon. Such equations will predict suspension behavior in arbitrary flow geometries and enable new strategies for controlling the viscosity.

Previous work on continuous shear thickening has shown that when perturbed orthogonally to the flow direction these networks can be broken apart allowing for complete dethickening of the suspension. This award will support experiments, simulations, and theory aimed at addressing knowledge gaps that would aid development of more efficient and broadly applicable dethickening strategies by tackling three outstanding questions in the area of shear thickening.  First, it is proposed to use experiments and simulations to determine whether the orthogonal shear technique can be extended to the discontinuous shear thickening and shear jamming regimes. Second, it is proposed that new shear protocols be developed to determine the tensorial nature of the viscosity. These measurements along with the simulations will be used to construct a tensorial model of the viscosity. Such a theory would aid in determining the contact network in other flow geometries. Third, a state of the art imaging confocal rheology technique will be used to image the contact network giving rise to thickening. These data will enable testing of theoretical predictions for the contact network.

Data analytic strategies, often under the banner of machine learning and artificial intelligence for example, offer new tools to help researchers gain valuable scientific insights from such data collections.  Unfortunately, there remains an adaptation gap between these tools and researchers with application domain knowledge who would benefit from the availability of more advanced data analysis methods.  This workshop seeks to identify convergent areas of chemical research that would most benefit from new cutting-edge tools for data analysis and to identify means of reducing the impediments to broad and rapid adoption of such tools by researchers with relevant application domain knowledge.  The workshop will also explore needs and means for training of students in valuable data analysis skills.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together researchers in the chemical sciences and related areas (e.g., environmental analysis, biological chemistry, materials science, and national security monitoring) and experts in novel data analytics (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, graph theory).  Participants will explore the relationship between pressing scientific questions in convergent application fields and the potential for new analytical methods that uniquely address these questions.  For example, how might graph theory or network analyses advance prediction of new catalysts and more efficient reaction sequences?  What insights might machine learning or artificial intelligence derive from high-resolution, multivariate images of catalytic surfaces?  How can sensor arrays be best adapted to improve understanding and prediction of the chemistry of dynamic environmental processes?  Participants will strive to identify where collaborations are necessary to advance convergence research and means of facilitating establishment of those collaborations.  The workshop will also consider the education and training needs for creating a research workforce versed in both measurement science and data analysis.

Chemical transformations ranging from fundamental investigations to industrial manufacturing are often conducted in solution. It is usually true that the various chemical species are uniformly dispersed throughout the solution. While this often simplifies chemical processes it can also be a limitation. For example, some reactants may not be compatible with each other, with their reactions leading to undesirable side reactions and waste. In these cases it is advantageous to keep these species separated.  Dr. Liu is accomplishing this challenge with electrochemistry using arrays of nanometer scale wires. Successful implementation of the proposed work would potentially offer a new paradigm in chemical synthesis with a multifaceted approach involving nanoscience, electrochemistry, and catalysis. Dr. Liu's research team, including women and students from underrepresented groups, will be engaged in highly interdisciplinary research in this project. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Liu and his team hypothesize that the electrochemistry of nanowire arrays yields controllable local O2 gradient microscopically, which enables O2-sensitive organometallic catalysts to perform oxidative reactions such as direct methane (CH4) to methanol (CH3OH) conversion.

By nature of the broad-ranging topic areas these institutions emphasize, programming seeks to reach audiences that vary in age, ability, cultural background, interest, and more. Participation also varies--for example, participants choose which in a series of exhibits they attend and how much time they spend at each. Given this planned-for variance, how do educators target appropriate learning outcomes? To what extent do outcomes map to activity complexity? How does programming success link to institutional goals? One solution may be a framework of outcome progressions. \\u201cProgressions\\u201d are within outcome categories (e.g., interest, attitude, knowledge, skills, behavior, science capital, etc.), the ordinal series of effects that can be mapped to programming that ranges from short duration with simple content (e.g. a hallway cart demonstration can trigger situational interest) to extended duration with complex content (e.g. a youth internship can generate well-developed personal interest). STEM educators, evaluators and researchers working in or with ISL institutions will come together to consider the utility and feasibility of an outcome progressions framework. With this framework STEM learning institution educators may be better equipped to understand the impact of their programming and how to design for it.

In spite of their notoriety and the fear that they often inspire, huge gaps in our knowledge remain for some groups of spiders. Often generalized as small and brown or grey, many spiders in the family Dictynidae are quite colorful, and are perhaps most notable for their intriguing distributional patterns and fascinating ecological characteristics. In fact, this \\u201cdark corner\\u201d of the spider tree of life comprises a group that occupies virtually every terrestrial ecosystem on earth and contains the only fully aquatic spider species. While some species are endemic to very small areas, others are some of the most widespread of all spider species. This level of variation within a single family of spiders shows considerable potential as a system for answering a broad range of evolutionary and ecological questions, especially as they relate to the evolution of specific characteristics or behaviors. This project aims to resolve the evolutionary relationships among this group of spiders and their relative position within the spider tree of life, shining a light on one of the most poorly known parts of the spider tree of life.  Additionally, a main goal of this project is to train the next generation of taxonomic experts, organismal biologists and systematists in Dictynid spiders in the US.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dictynidae are a hugely diverse family nested within the \\u201cmarronoid clade\\u201d.

We aim to open the door to evolutionary and ecological studies of the group by creating a taxonomic and phylogenetic scaffold in support of further research for years to come. We will accomplish this by: 1) Revising the moderately diverse, unusual genus Lathys using morphological data and data gathered from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS); 2) Determining the phylogenetic relationships of all dictynid genera using NGS data; 3) Using NGS data to determine the placement of Dictynidae within the spider tree of life. We will collect both specimens of Lathys and representatives of all dictynid genera worldwide with our multinational team of collaborators. Standardized images from all specimens, including types, will be produced using high-resolution stacked images, SEM micrographs, and microCT scanning of nearly 50 amber fossils to allow for consistent morphological analysis. Low coverage genome sequencing will be used to produce molecular data that will be incorporated with the morphological matrix to subsequently be analyzed using Bayesian Inference. This method allows the analysis of a combined morphological and molecular dataset, paramount for the inclusion of fossil taxa, which subsequently allows us to use tip dating to produce a time-calibrated phylogeny. We will conduct these analyses separately at three taxonomic scales: Lathys, all dictynid genera, and the \\u201cmarronoid clade\\u201d.

Digital technologies have enabled these ubiquitous robots with easier and faster human-like audio-visual interactions. However, the lack of physical interaction has posed a significant barrier to human-robot shared tasks, which is essential in applications that require complex physical interactions during the shared tasks. A great number of studies on physical interaction between human dyads or pairs have been conducted during the past decade. Several studies showed that dyadic physical interaction improves the performance of two individuals working together on shared tasks compared to working alone. Amazingly, results showed that human dyads not only perform better, but also learn new tasks faster. Therefore, understanding how human dyads physically interact can be applied while provide insight in developing human-like robots, which to mimic human behavior when performing shared tasks with other humans or robots. The vision of this work is to understand the underlying mechanisms of human dyadic physical interaction that lead to improvement in motor performances and learning rates, and to integrate this knowledge in developing new robotic controllers. Additionally, the infrastructure of the controller and findings will be shared as open source, and educational programs will be developed to support the advancement of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many factors that define the physical interaction between dyads, such as the interactive behavior (i.e., collaboration, competition, cooperation), haptic connection (i.e., impedance levels), and skill levels of the dyads (i.e., novice-novice and expert-novice). Therefore, a systematic approach that can quantitatively compare each condition is crucial. To realize the vision of this work, a novel exoskeleton-based dyadic interaction infrastructure will be implemented to study physical dyadic interaction with multiple DOF and multiple contact points by providing virtual connections of varying and controllable impedance between the exoskeleton systems. This infrastructure will be utilized to reveal comprehensive knowledge of how the task performance and motor learning of peers in dyadic haptic interaction are affected by 1) physical interactive behaviors, 2) impedance of the multi-joint virtual connection, and 3) the skill level of peers. Then, new human-like controllers, namely, co3-robot controllers where the suffix co3 refers to robots endowed with collaborative, competitive, and cooperative human-like interactive motor behaviors, will be synthesized based on a force-impedance adaptation model and a neural network feedback error learning model of interacting peers. Finally, the co3-robot controller will be implemented to a lower limb exoskeleton and will be validated by passing a haptic Turing test, showing that the controller is indistinguishable from a human partner during dyadic physical interactions.

Despite significant effort in simulating these systems using conventional supercomputers, progress has been limited by a fundamental barrier of computational complexity which veils an unexplored frontier of physics called the entanglement frontier.  Quantum computers are naturally able to probe this frontier because they harness entanglement in their elementary operations, and so the eventual development of mature quantum computing technology will greatly advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions and enable the discovery of new phases of quantum matter with potentially transformative properties for technology and society.  All of this depends on the development of efficient quantum algorithms for simulating the thermodynamic properties of quantum systems.  This project investigates the quantum Metropolis algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm that directly generalizes one of the most successful 20th century paradigms for simulating classical statistical physics.   By paralleling developments that occurred in the corresponding classical algorithm, this project seeks to determine general conditions which imply that a quantum computer can efficiently simulate quantum thermal properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main new perspective used in this project is based on a connection between physical thermalization - the process by which a physical quantum system comes into thermal equilibrium with its environment - and the behavior and convergence of the quantum Metropolis algorithm.

This project connects mathematical inequalities developed in the context of the ETH directly to the transition probabilities that govern the behavior of the quantum Metropolis algorithm.  This quantitative characterization of transition probabilities opens the door to establishing the first non-trivial cases of rigorously efficient (polynomial-time) quantum algorithms for simulating thermal states of some class of quantum systems that is strongly suspected to be beyond the range of efficient classical simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.615054130554199, \"y\": 9.342192649841309}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Rapid Climate Change During the Miocene Climate Optimum: A Proxy-Model Comparison\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The Miocene Climatic Optimum, between 18 and 13 million years ago, is one of Earth's most recent prolonged warming events with peak global surface temperature about 7 degrees Celsius (13 degrees Fahrenheit) above present and characterized by intervals of abrupt variability.

Therefore, this period of warmer climate may provide a useful benchmark to understand future climate change.

Over the last 30 years, network analysis \\u2014 a method for measuring and modeling the patterns of connections between objects (people, places, proteins, etc.) \\u2014 has emerged as a prominent data-intensive research theme with broad applications and with significant Federal research investment.  Network analysis is unique amongst methodologies in its focus on interdependence, allowing investigators to understand how, for example, diseases spread through populations, hostile groups organize, or predator/prey patterns of species shape an ecosystem, as well as myriad other substantive applications.  Despite the wide use of network analysis, the analytical and computational tools are highly specialized and often have domain-specific idiosyncrasies that severely limit integration across fields and creates unnaturally high barriers to entry for investigators new to network analysis who want to apply these methods to their problems.  Moreover, current computational tools manage data in ways that make errors undetectable and easy to make, lowering rigor and reproducibility in network analysis studies.  The new computational toolkit and data storage framework developed in IDEANet aims to solve these problems through its integration of analytic methods and data archiving, discovery, and distribution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make network data easier to find, use and share, four integrated objectives are pursued in IDEANet: (1) Provision of an easy-to-use software tool, integrated via the R statistical programming language, with methodologically state-of-the-art analysis routines and metrics, developed in parallel with a ShinyR app that allows GUI use for R novices; (2) Construction of a network data translation engine that allows users to easily move data between the myriad extant formats found across application fields; (3) Provision of a core metrics compute engine that automatically generates vetted best practice metrics on network data of multiple types; (4) Development of a data repository and archival system that leverages the compute tools to build harmonized network data releases in multiple formats with pre-computed summary statistics and metrics, tailored to different levels of security.

But can such action-at-distance also arise when the two sites reside on different, but closely interacting, biological assemblies? This project seeks to address this question by experimentally investigating long-distance communication between cellular membranes and a ubiquitous protein called E-cadherin, which is embedded within these membranes. This project uses single-molecule measurements with model membranes and living cells to tease-out relations between the mechanical properties of the membrane and the molecular-level organization and function of E-cadherin. These studies will address how cell membranes control the reorganization of E-cadherins on the cell surface and consequently regulate cell interactions and cell migration during tissue formation and wound healing. The effort also provides benefit to the broader scientific community by establishing a new paradigm that links the global material properties of cellular membranes with biochemical behaviors of individual proteins. The work will (1) train graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary collaborative research combining tools, techniques, and perspectives from membrane biophysics, single molecule science, soft matter, mechanobiology, and biochemistry and (2) implement proactive mechanisms to engage underrepresented minorities and contribute directly to enhancing diversity, inclusion, and equity with the STEM fields.

However, despite the tremendous theoretical and experimental progress in computer vision, machine learning, and sensor fusion, the form and conditions under which guarantees should be provided for perception components is still unclear. The state-of-the-art is to perform scenario-based evaluation of data against ground truth values, but this has only limited impact. The lack of formal metrics to analyze the quality of perception systems has already led to several catastrophic incidents and a plateau in ADS/ADAS development. This project develops formal languages for specifying and evaluating the quality and robustness of perception sub-systems within ADS and ADAS applications.   To enable broader dissemination of this technology, the project develops graduate and undergraduate curricula to train engineers in the use of such methods, and new educational modules to explain the challenges in developing safe and robust ADS for outreach and public engagement activities. To broaden participation in computing, the investigators target the inclusion of undergraduate women in research and development phases through summer internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The formal language developed in this project is based on a new spatio-temporal logic pioneered by the investigators. This logic allows one to simultaneously perform temporal reasoning about streaming perception data, and spatially reason about objects both within a single frame of the data and across frames.  The project also develops quantitative semantics for this logic, which provides the user with quantifiable quality metrics for perception sub-systems. These semantics enable comparisons between different perception systems and architectures. Crucially, the formal language facilitates the process of abstracting away implementation details, which in turn allows system designers and regulators to specify assumptions and guarantees for system performance at a higher-level of abstraction. An interesting benefit of this formal language is that it enables querying of databases with perception data for specific driving scenarios without the need for the highly manual process of creating ground truth annotations. Such a formal language currently does not exist, and this is a huge impediment to building a thriving marketplace for perception components used in safety-critical systems.

The computing courses implementing HFOSS will use Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning to scaffold students' computer science learning and early professional skill development. Research conducted by the project team is designed to advance knowledge about constructivist approaches to computing education including guided inquiry learning and communities of practice. This research includes innovative studies of the changes in role and identity of instructor and student that accompany a shift to active learning, together with studies of student engagement, retention, and diversity.

The work will take place under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Lamb at California Institute of Technology. Accelerating climate change in the Arctic is leading to the widespread thawing of permafrost (ice and soil that typically remains frozen throughout the year).  The loss of permafrost results in weakening of riverbanks, river channel migration and speeds up the release of greenhouse gasses and heavy metals. These environmental issues combined with changes in the shape of rivers have led to the displacement of communities in the Arctic. This project seeks to characterize the ways that the composition of permafrost riverbank impacts the rate of riverbank erosion and river channel migration in the Arctic. The work includes a series of experiments to determine the properties that control erosion and river migration, contributing to a framework for improved management of river systems in polar regions and a better understanding of the global carbon cycle. The project also includes education and outreach activities that incorporate preexisting California Institute of Technology programs for high school and undergraduate students. Dr. Dunne also plans to develop and distribute online educational modules on river processes hosted on SedEdu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huge regions of land in the Arctic through which rivers incise are comprised of permafrost. The presence of pore ice in permafrost substrates has been shown to have a profound effect on the erodibility bank material as pore ice greatly increases the yield strength of frozen soil relative to unfrozen soil. As a result, the erosion rates of permafrost soils are highly sensitive to climate-driven changes to both local hydrological and atmospheric temperature conditions. This study seeks to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of permafrost composition and water temperature on the erosion rate of frozen riverbanks. A suite of experiments will be performed to determine the effects of cohesive sediment on the thermomechanical and geotechnical properties of permafrost substrates that govern the rate of riverbank erosion in Arctic regions. This experimental approach will be coupled with analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery of natural, permafrost rivers in the Arctic to determine how rates of channel bank erosion and lateral migration changes throughout the year in response to the governing mechanisms explored in the lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.6888346672058105, \"y\": 5.954026699066162}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Advancing Equity and Strengthening Teaching with Elementary Mathematical Modeling\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Students bring many mathematical assets to the classroom from their life experiences in their cultures and communities, particularly with respect to being able to model real-world situations in their everyday lives with mathematics.

Supporting teachers to make use of mathematical modeling in the elementary classroom to advance issues of equity will require targeted teacher professional development (PD).  Advancing Equity and Strengthening Teaching with Elementary Mathematical Modeling is a teacher PD project focused on strengthening K-5 teaching with mathematics modeling. Building on previous foundational work around mathematics modeling and equity, this project will bring together equity oriented teaching practices and mathematical modeling to design and research the impact of a blended PD program on teacher practice. The project will include video-enhanced reflection and online mentoring in addition to face-to-face components of PD.  Using five pivotal spaces for elementary mathematics modeling as a framework, the project will explore the ways in which tools and structures that support practices aligned with pivotal spaces in mathematics modeling lessons can help teachers advance equitable participation and develop student competencies in mathematics modeling.

A wide range of D-DNA molecular sensors, circuits and actuators have been developed in recent years, but their utility in living cells and organisms is limited by this issue. This CAREER project will enhance the practical utility of DNA-based molecular devices by engineering systems that include mirror-image \\u201cleft-handed\\u201d DNA (L-DNA).

In the meantime, advances in technologies such as autonomous systems and artificial intelligence promise enormous economic and societal benefits. Naturally, it is desirable to deploy these technologies in IoT infrastructures. However, such deployments present daunting changes for increasingly scaled-up IoT infrastructures in mission-critical applications such as medical, energy, transportation, and industrial-automation systems. These challenges stem from several major aspects in terms of scalability. First, the number of edge devices can be enormous, often in the order of billions, which makes centralized management infeasible. Second, there are multiple layers of heterogeneity. An IoT system can consist of heterogeneous computing subsystems; each subsystem can have heterogeneous computing devices; and each single device can be composed of different kinds of computing components. Third, mission-critical applications have stringent requirements in correctness, resilience, timeliness, security and safety. It is difficult for a large-scale IoT system to satisfy these requirements due to increasing opportunities for adversarial activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To tackle these challenges, this project aims to develop a cross-layer and full hardware/software stack solution, referred to as the S3-IoT framework, for the design and deployment of scalable, secure, and smart mission-critical IoT systems. The S3-IoT framework will span three different computation layers, including data centers, gateways/aggregators, and edge devices, and cover four research foci, i.e., resource management, security and privacy, computer architecture/systems, and algorithms. In this planning project, an initial version of the S3-IoT framework will be developed. The S3-IoT framework will (i) leverage a layered structure - data centers, gateways/aggregators, and edge devices to accommodate the huge number of edge devices; (ii) develop cross-layer techniques to deal with the heterogeneity among these layers; and (iii) propose hardware and software co-design approaches that embrace the heterogeneity among computing components to improve the performance of all components within an individual layer. The S3-IoT framework will be evaluated by developing simulators with the layered structure as well as a small scale, comprehensive experimental testbed.

The PI and a collaborator have discovered, an alternative axiomatic formulation for 2D-topological quantum field theory by edge contraction operations of ribbon graphs. The set of rules based on edge contractions also represent the key structure of topological recursion.  The edge contraction axioms reflect both the structure of a Frobenius algebra and the pair of pants decomposition of a topological surface.

While there have been many initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented minority faculty, systematic efforts have not been designed to address the completion of doctoral degrees amongst this population. Data show that students, particularly underrepresented students, are leaving before obtaining a degree because of the long, arduous, and uncertain road to graduation. These data also suggest that individuals, graduate schools, and society would benefit from efforts to reduce time-to-degree and degree completion rates. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to offer a practical and timely experience particularly for underrepresented doctoral students in engineering (African American, Native American, Pacific Island and Hispanic American) to address issues germane to shortening time-to-degree and degree completion rates. The specific aims are to: 1) conduct research to understand the motivational factors that promote and detract from degree progress and 2) to develop and offer the Dissertation Institute (Institute) to provide underrepresented doctoral students in engineering with motivating, helpful strategies for avoiding pitfalls that prolong completion times, particularly those at the dissertation proposal preparation and dissertation completion stages. Current efforts to support underrepresented doctoral students have tended to be local opportunities within specific programs or universities. This project is different from existing efforts because it will systematically examine and positively impact the motivational factors that promote dissertation completion across multiple sites to consider and incorporate contextually relevant factors such that the Institute is transferable across contexts and not limited to local implementation. This transferability is critical to developing a sustainable future program to support underrepresented students.

To achieve the outcomes of our study, we have designed a multi-method, multi-phased study. We will examine and draw on stakeholder needs to develop an Institute that is consistent with literature suggestions and effective practices but also contextually relevant for participants. Finally, we will comparatively analyze the data across sites to allow us to identify the key elements on which we should focus in considering transferability of the Institute to additional sites and/or through online means. The research will directly impact approximately 170 underrepresented doctoral students and will contribute to the long-term sustainability of other Institute models. In addition to improving basic writing habits and skills, Institute participants will gain practical strategies for: 1) distinguishing between behaviors that foster or hinder success, 2) increasing engagement in positive behaviors and eliminating destructive behaviors, 3) developing plans to maneuver through the dissertation phase from selecting a topic to completing the dissertation, and 4) establishing realistic program completion goals and plans for implementing those goals.

The timing of at least some of these extinctions often coincides with human arrival into newly colonized areas. While extinctions since the last ice age have occurred worldwide, the islands that make up the Caribbean have been perhaps the single hardest hit region. This island system, rich in well-preserved paleontological and archaeological sites, has preserved a spectacular record of both past bird diversity and human occupation. Still, our knowledge of the patterns, causes, and consequences of long-term changes to Caribbean bird communities remains surprisingly limited. This knowledge gap hampers our understanding of past diversity changes and its causes, and thus our ability to manage and conserve remaining diversity into the future. This research focuses on closing these knowledge gaps using DNA from fossils (ancient DNA) to understand taxonomic affinities of extinct species, and radiocarbon dating to determine the last occurrence of a species. This approach provides critical information to determine who these species were, and to time their losses in relation to climate change and waves of human arrivals to the islands. This project also focuses on the characteristics of species that have made them more vulnerable to extinction (for example, flightlessness) as a means to more completely understand the causes of extinction in the past and forecast the extinction risk for existing species. This project has broad societal impact through its educational and outreach components.

Less well understood is the role humans have played in these extinctions and population losses. Because human arrival to these islands occurred much later than on the mainland, archeological and paleontological evidence can be used to determine how humans interacted with the local fauna upon their arrival to domesticate, translocate, and cause the extinction of some species. Evidence of this lost avian diversity is fragmentary, often represented by only a few specimens with limited morphological characters. This causes challenges for proper phylogenetic placement, especially given potential for convergence due to shared life histories such as flightlessness. In this project researchers will build phylogenetic trees of clades of birds including modern, extinct and extirpated taxa to determine the phylogenetic and trait affinities of these species. This work will also elucidate biogeographic patterns of the full endemic fauna of the Caribbean, that has been obscured due to extinctions of enigmatic taxa, and build a picture of the level of biodiversity loss in terms of phylogenetic and trait diversity. A key next step is to then integrate new phylogenetic knowledge into a larger context of overall avian diversity patterns to explicitly quantify past loss of phylogenetic diversity across the Caribbean. We will generate a new metric, diversity loss risk, that integrates insight from phylogenetics, traits, and past extinction events to reveal which extant species are of greatest concern for preventing permanent phylogenetic diversity loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.5027384757995605, \"y\": 5.111048221588135}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"W-Algebras and Universal Objects in Vertex Algebra Theory\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Many structures and concepts that were inspired by physics have had a profound influence on mathematics during the last half century.

These projects will advance the subject and provide educational and collaborative opportunities for the PI's current and former graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the PI's work on the coset realization of principal W-algebras of A, D, and E types resolved a 30-year-old conjecture which had been a key starting assumption in physics. It has many striking corollaries such as the unitarity of all discrete series representations of principal W-algebras, and the existence of modular tensor categories of modules for affine VOAs at admissible levels. The PI will construct coset realizations of principal W-algebras of other Lie types, as well as non-principal W-algebras and W-superalgebras. Second, the PI recently constructed a universal two-parameter VOA which interpolates between all the type A principal W-algebras, in the sense that they arise as one-parameter quotients of this structure. The PI will construct more general universal objects, which are VOAs defined over the ring of functions on some variety X. Typically, interesting VOAs are obtained by specializing the universal object along certain subvarieties of X, and unexpected isomorphisms of these VOAs correspond to intersection points on these subvarieties. Third, the PI will study two affine schemes that have been attached to a VOA by Arakawa: the associated scheme and the singular support. There is always a closed embedding of the singular support in the arc space of the associated scheme. The PI will investigate good criteria for this embedding to be an isomorphism. This has many applications in VOA theory and is connected to questions about the geometry of arc spaces that are of independent interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.135557651519775, \"y\": 9.7868013381958}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"EAGER: Collaborative Research: Substructure-aware Spatiotemporal Representation Learning\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Spatiotemporal networked data are an essential representation of information about critical infrastructures such as transportation networks, power grids, and social networks. The evolving vehicle mobility of a transportation network can locate the source of traffic jams. The dynamic retweet keywords of a social network may inform a novel disease outbreak. This project will develop novel techniques to equip machines with automated and precision characterization with spatiotemporal networks. The main novelty of this project will be in its ability to preserve substructure patterns in characterization of spatiotemporal networked data. By recognizing and characterizing these substructure patterns such as a subnetwork of traffic jam, a subnetwork of overload or outage, computers can better extract semantics, forecast trends, and detect anomalies, which are important for operations, management, and defense of critical infrastructures. In transportation operations, the developed techniques have the potential to change how civil engineers identify the behavioral factors and surrounding features of precursor to crashes, fatalities, and accidents. For the researchers of power grid management, the automated and precision characterization approaches can help to inform the counter measures and characteristics of outrage events, such as generation loss, large load, series capacitor fault, and line trip. In public health and pandemics, the substructure awareness will enable the fast and early detection of novel diseases from subtle natural language patterns in social networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop novel machine learning technologies for learning substructure-aware representations of spatiotemporal networked data.  The research methodology will be motivated by long-stand and active research of deep representation learning and model regularization in optimization. The project will introduce the concept of substructure awareness which is a dynamic regularization mechanism to enforce representation learning models to pay attention to substructure patterns. This project will address two fundamental research challenges: 1) How can we model substructure knowledge in representation learning?  2) How can temporal dependencies improve substructure-aware representation learning?

These mechanisms will be contrasted with the responses to other hemispheric forcings, anthropogenic aerosols and volcanic eruptions, to assess their roles, and therefore improve the confidence of climate variability model predictions.

The detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes in 2015 launched the field of gravitational wave astronomy. Gravitational-wave detectors with a two-fold increase in sensitivity over Advanced LIGO would yield an order of magnitude increase in detection rate for black hole coalescences, and enable detection of fainter objects like binary neutron stars, greatly increasing their value for multi-messenger astronomy. All future detector upgrades and concepts rely on the development of new mirror coating materials to reduce thermal noise, which is the core research focus this collaborative project between Martin Fejer's group at Stanford University and Hai-Ping Cheng's group at the University of Florida. Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical loss in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with the mechanical and optical requirements for implementation in future generations of LIGO. Meeting this goal for room temperature detectors requires a solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: understanding the nature of and finding means to reduce the low-energy excitations in amorphous metal oxides. On a longer time-scale, the proposed 3G detectors' cryogenic operation broadens the possible choice of low-noise mirror materials to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mid-band sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO detectors is limited by thermal noise resulting from mechanical loss in the mirror coatings, and future upgrades including Advanced LIGO Plus will seek to reduce this source of noise by a factor of two or more. The Stanford-Florida partnership, alongside collaborators in the LSC Center for Coatings Research (CCR), has identified different structural motifs associated with room-temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, which led to synthesis of germania (GeO2) films, giving rise to the lowest-loss amorphous oxide film other than silica. Going forward, this structural guide, based on electron and x-ray scattering atomic structure data, will serve as a paradigm informing the development of high-refractive-index amorphous coatings with lower elastic loss. Atomic modeling of coating elastic loss combined with simulations of the coating deposition process will provide guidance for the selection of candidate materials, assist in interpretation of experimental structure data, and will ultimately assist in the design of synthesis experiments. Another long-standing effort at Stanford has been measurements of the absorption of low-optical-loss materials at the sub-ppm/cm level, dating back to the down select between silica and sapphire for initial LIGO test masses.

This phenomenon presents a serious scientific concern, as contamination minimizes real differences in the risk for adverse child development between child maltreatment and comparison conditions. The current project addresses this concern by testing different methods for detecting and controlling contamination bias in child maltreatment research. Specifically, investigators will access existing data from independent prospective cohort studies and examine the performance of five different statistical modeling approaches to determine which has the optimal control of contamination. Two bias reduction modeling approaches, propensity score and augmented synthetic control models, will be executed with results compared against three conventional approaches: no control of contamination, controlling contamination by removing identified participants from the statistical model, and controlling contamination by testing it as a covariate or moderator of risk estimates. Investigators will then use data simulations to model the performance of these five methods across different research conditions, including variations in contamination prevalence, sample size, statistical power, and effect size magnitude. Ultimately, the best performing methods for detecting and controlling contamination in child maltreatment research will be disseminated to scientists so that future risk estimates are more accurate, something that can better inform child welfare policy through more reliable scientific data. While tested within child maltreatment research, results from the statistical models evaluated in this project will be available to any scientist conducting observational research on exposure variables, enhancing the reliability of scientific results across STEM domains. Finally, knowledge on how to use these methods will be incorporated into STEM education at the University-level by educating undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral fellows on how to control contamination in prospective cohort studies within and outside the area of child maltreatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contamination, when subjects recruited to a non-exposure comparison condition have been  exposed to the event under investigation, is a methodological phenomenon in observational research that downwardly biases effect size estimates by minimizing group differences, thereby increasing replication and reproducibility failures. The current project will evaluate the performance of multiple strategies for detecting and controlling contamination bias in prospective cohort research with the child maltreatment population. This will be achieved through secondary analysis of existing data from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN; N=1354) and the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being-II (NSCAWII; N=5873) cohorts, each of which are multi-wave, prospective cohort studies of child maltreatment from birth through age eighteen. A multi-method approach of official case reports, self-report, and caregiver-report assessments obtained across child development will be used to maximize sensitivity for detecting contamination and establishing its prevalence in these cohorts. Two innovative methods for controlling bias in observational research, doubly robust propensity score and augmented synthetic controls, will be used to control contamination bias in each of these cohorts. Results from these two models will be evaluated against alternative models that: 1) ignore contamination, 2) control contamination by removing subjects from statistical analysis, and 3) control contamination by estimating it as a covariate/moderator of child maltreatment effects. Following statistical efficiency principles, the performance of all five models will be benchmarked with respect to needed sample size, impact on statistical power, and extent of bias reduction in effect size estimates. Given the ultimate goal to identify which methods provide the most accurate estimates under different empirical conditions, this project will also evaluate results from all five models using simulations that both mimic the data structures of LONGSCAN and NSCAW-II and extend out to conditions commonly encountered in prospective cohort studies, including variations in contamination prevalence, sample size, and effect size magnitude. These results will have broader scientific and public impacts by: disseminating results to scientists outside the area of child maltreatment who conduct research where contamination is present, training the next generation of STEM scientists in the optimal methods for detecting and controlling contamination, and providing more accurate estimates of the risks associated with child maltreatment to better inform child welfare policy in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 2.9584295749664307, \"y\": 6.707598686218262}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Opening Pathways into Engineering Through an Illinois Physics and Secondary Schools Partnership\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project will conduct research and teacher professional development (PD) to adapt university-level instructional materials for implementation by high school teachers in their physics courses.

The project will adapt two key components of U of I\\u2019s undergraduate physics curriculum for high school use by: (1) using a web-based \\u201cflipped\\u201d platform, smartPhysics, which contains online pre-lectures, pre-labs and homework and (2) using research-based physics lab activities targeting scientific skill development, utilizing the iOLab wireless lab system \\u2013 a compact device that contains all sensors necessary for hundreds of physics labs with an interface that supports quick data collection and analysis. The program adopts two PD elements that support sustained, in-depth teacher engagement: (1) incremental expansion of the pool of teachers to a cohort of 40 by the end of the project, with a range of physics teaching assignments and work collaboratively with a physics teaching community to develop advanced physics instruction for their particular classroom contexts, (2) involvement in a combination of intensive summer PD sessions containing weekly PD meetings with university project staff that value teachers\\u2019 agency in designing their courses, and the formation of lasting professional relationships between teachers. The IPaSS Partnership Program also addresses needs for guidance, support and resources as teachers adapt to the shifts in Advanced Placement (AP) Physics standards. The recent revised high school physics curriculum that emphasizes deep conceptual understanding of central physical principles and scientific practices will be learned through the inquiry-based laboratory work. The planned research will address three central questions: (1) How does IPaSS impact teachers\\u2019 practice? (2) Does the program encourage student proficiency in physics and their pursuit of STEM topics beyond the course? (3) What aspects of the U of I curricula must be adapted to the structures of the high school classroom to best serve high school student populations? To answer these questions, several streams of data will be collected: Researchers will collect instructional artifacts and video recordings from teachers\\u2019 PD activities and classroom teaching throughout the year to trace the development of teachers\\u2019 pedagogical and instructional development. The students of participating teachers will be surveyed on their physics knowledge, attitudes, and future career aspirations before and after their physics course, video recordings of student groupwork will be made, and student written coursework and grades will be collected. Finally, high school students will be surveyed post-graduation about their STEM education and career trajectories. The result of this project will be a community of Illinois physics teachers who are engaged in continual development of advanced high school physics curricula, teacher-documented examples of these curricula suited for a range of school and classroom contexts, and a research-based set of PD principles aimed at supporting students\\u2019 future STEM opportunities and engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

The new technological innovations proposed here will more quickly identify bacteria responsible for the vast majority of blood infections while providing vital phenotypic data on antibiotics and dosages effective for treating these infections. This will improve patient outcomes through faster diagnosis and more precise antibiotic selection while also helping to combat the growing incidence of multidrug-resistant infections by reducing broad prescription of these drugs, which is critical to efforts to preserve the usefulness of existing antibiotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a new tests for direct-from-specimen identification (ID), antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and minimum inhibitory drug concentration (MIC) determination against Escherichia coli in blood. A significant limitation with existing standards-of-care is time required for actionable results; current approaches require 18-72 hrs. Due to the time required, physicians must make empiric antimicrobial therapy decisions that often lead to negative patient outcomes. Genotypic approaches are limited because of the varied mechanisms utilized by bacteria to evolve resistance, which can lead to false-negative results. Mass spectrometry requires colony isolation and provides ID only. Other time-consuming tests are then required for AST and MIC. Rapid phenotypic approaches are needed.

Given the scale of these problems, solving such PDEs requires supercomputing resources. The latest supercomputing architectures are different from the previous generation of leadership class architectures and and are characterized by high levels of diversity within and across machines. Such diversity and heterogeneity makes it extremely difficult to effectively distribute work, i.e., partition the data or tasks, across disparate computing resources. Since the primary objective of building leadership class machines is to further scientific discovery and national prosperity, it is essential that applications, old and new, are able to scale and utilize these machines to their full potential. This project develops novel data and task partitioning algorithms that factor in the architectural characteristics of modern supercomputers to enable efficient and scalable utilization of current and future computing architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing data and task partitioning schemes do not explicitly consider the underlying architectural topology while partitioning or is done indirectly during the design of the algorithm and codes. Ignoring topology leads to loss of scalability and performance, while shifting the burden to algorithm/code design increases the development costs and complexity, and decreases portability.  While data and task partitioning for parallelization, along with mapping the partitions to processes, have been studied for a long time, they have not been considered as a combined problem. To a large extent this was due to the simple structures and symmetry that existed in cluster computing architectures. Inefficiencies that did not significantly impact performance and scalability ten years ago are starting to inhibit scalability and thereby scientific discovery. This project is a first step in ensuring that scientific discovery is not hampered as a result of the difficulty in porting codes to new architectures. This project develops new graph and space-filling-curve-based partitioning algorithms that are aware of the architectural topology and are able to automatically generate data/task partitions and mappings to address problems with current schemes.

It consists of a liquid outer shell - the outer core - enveloping the solid inner core. As the Earth cools down over time, liquid iron freezes, growing the inner core and providing energy to the outer core to generate Earth\\u2019s magnetic field. The inner core is spherical in shape but appears not to be uniform. The speed of seismic waves traveling through it depends on their direction, a feature known as anisotropy. Seismic waves traversing the inner core along a north-south path (near-parallel to the Earth\\u2019s rotation axis) go faster than those propagating along an east-west path (in the plane of the equator). Inner-core seismic anisotropy carries information about the conditions at the time of iron freezing.  It has been attributed to alignment of iron crystals in specific directions; but the processes causing this alignment is unclear. Interpreting this feature has been challenging because of the complex processes involved and the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in the core. Here, the researchers test experimentally how samples of iron behave at core conditions. They analyse data from experiments carried out in the diamond anvil cell where extreme conditions are generated at the tips of two opposing diamonds. They use computational models to characterpize iron crystal alignment during the experiments and calculate the resulting seismic velocities. They use seismic analytical methods to map the velocity structure of the inner core. Combined with geodynamic modeling, the multidisciplinary approach allows simulating inner-core growth and unveiling the processes causing its present-day anisotropy.  The project supports an early career scientist. It promotes the training in a multidisciplinary context of graduate and undergraduate students, notably from underrepresented groups in geosciences. It fosters outreach towards local schools and community colleges. The project outcomes will be broadly and freely distributed to the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding inner-core crystallization is central to understanding the geodynamo. Inner-core seismic anisotropy is attributed to alignments of intrinsically anisotropic iron crystals. Here, the researchers investigate the causes and controlling factors of this anisotropy, and how inner-core processes influence outer core processes. Coupling seismic analysis, mineral physics experiments, and geodynamic modeling, they investigate the dynamics and mineralogical control of crystal alignments within the inner core. They use both laboratory data and computational plasticity models to constrain the behavior of iron at inner-core conditions, placing limits on the mineralogical processes able to generate seismic anisotropy. Concurrently, with geodynamic models they simulate inner-core growth and determine the pattern and strength of flows and forcing that impact crystal orientation. They test possible feedback of anisotropic thermal and electrical transport properties of aligned crystals on inner-core dynamic evolution. Existing and new seismic measurements provide observational constraints to test possible growth models for the inner core. Key questions addressed by the team are: how is global anisotropy generated during inner-core growth? What caused the present-day orientation of anisotropy? Can growth models be reconciled with spatial seismic structure across a range of length scales? What effect does crystallization texture have on final anisotropy?

Different types of liquid crystals have significant variability in terms of molecular structure and arrangement, which results in different mechanical and optical properties. Understanding the differences and the similarities between liquid crystal phases opens new paths to create not only the next generation of liquid crystal displays but also of a broader range of liquid crystal-based nanomaterials; furthermore, it helps answering fundamental questions regarding transitions between different states of matter. The goal of this research is to quantify the similarities and differences between liquid crystal phases by using polymers as mediators. Polymers can be dispersed in liquid crystals to create an \\u201cimprint\\u201d of the molecular order, which can then be transferred to a different liquid crystal.

This study investigates how large facilities are impacted by, and are responding to, the pandemic challenge with a focus on understanding factors related to the use of existing CI. This project will also explore the value of CI in the broader social context of how people and the facilities perceive and respond to major disruptive events. The goal is to determine how to design large facility organizations to be more resilient during crises and major disasters and what CI capabilities are needed to support these and other large science projects to accomplish their science missions during such disruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study comprises three main research questions related to NSF large facilities and CI during the pandemic: (a) What types of research activities remain \\\"business as usual\\\" and what types of activities must adapt or stop completely under pandemic conditions? (b) If facilities could turn back time, what would they have done to better prepare? And (c) What lessons are facilities learning from the current disruptions, and how can these be best disseminated to the facility, CI, and research communities? The approach is grounded in Weick's Theory of Organizing, and examines disruptions from the environment (ecological change) through the stages of enactment (immediate actions), selection (rules establishment), and retention (identification of approaches worth re-utilizing in future events), with feedback loops linking the stages and the environment. The project\\u2019s goals will be accomplished primarily through interviews with domain scientists, CI users, developers, and administrators who are engaged in NSF large facility science and operations. The project will also analyze and document the organizational structures of the facilities to identify the key engagement points with national CI resources and services, towards enhancing the ability of the broader CI community to engage with the facilities. The ultimate objective of this project is to provide a framework for facilities and other large science projects to mitigate disruptions to their scientific and operational activities in current and future times of crisis.

Some of this frozen reservoir melts at the surface and directly enters the ocean. Some of the ice instead breaks off, making icebergs that melt as they float around the ocean like ice cubes in a glass of water. Where and when this freshwater enters the ocean can influence the ocean currents that carry heat, salt, and vital nutrients for marine life. However, we cannot tell if recent changes to the amount of Greenland ice that is melted and mixed into the ocean are important because we don\\u2019t yet have accurate maps of where exactly this freshwater enters the ocean. In this project, we will combine 1) photos of Greenland\\u2019s coastline taken from satellites and 2) measurements of the warm, salty, and fast coastal waters taken from ships and instruments in the ocean. From these observations we will create new maps of how much Greenland icebergs melted from 2010 to 2023. Our science team will develop outreach activities that focus on iceberg melting and will work with an artist to educate the public about the importance of iceberg melt and inspire them to think more about the Earth\\u2019s fascinating icy features. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing freshwater flux from the Greenland Ice Sheet influences ocean properties, with potentially large consequences for circulation, marine ecosystems, and climate at local-to-global scales. The severity of the downstream effects depends on: the fingerprint of meltwater runoff from the ice-sheet surface, meltwater produced where the ice sheet flows into the relatively warm and salty ocean, and meltwater injected into the ocean by the gradual decay of icebergs. Variations in freshwater produced by iceberg melt are poorly mapped and yet may be incredibly important since icebergs can transport cold, fresh meltwater far from the ice-sheet margins to remote ocean basins. In this project, we will combine independent iceberg melt rate estimation methods using satellite and ocean observations. We will investigate the drivers of iceberg melt and also quantify potential errors and the uncertainty in each of our methods. We will pair the iceberg melt rate estimates with observations of iceberg production from the Greenland Ice Sheet to construct time series of iceberg freshwater flux from 2010 to 2023. The project will yield time series of iceberg meltwater flux maps and determine how iceberg meltwater compares to other freshwater sources, such as surface and subglacial meltwater runoff from the ice sheet. We will also produce several novel datasets (e.g., spatially distributed iceberg size distributions, melt rates, and freshwater flux time series) that will be valuable for studies focused on ice sheet-ocean interactions. We will incorporate data products produced by the project into the open-source QGreenland geographic information system package as part of efforts to increase data accessibility and use.

Composite materials, for example, are manufactured by intermingling two or more constituent materials and often have very different physical properties (heat or electrical conduction, for example) from the individual components. Surprisingly, the properties of the composite material are typically not a simple average of those of its components--it matters greatly how the (microscopic) intermingling is arranged. We want to understand precisely how the large number of microscopic interactions give rise to the macroscopic behavior of such systems, to be able to predict the macroscopic properties of the system by carefully looking at the microscopic arrangement of a sample, and to know exactly how large such a sample must be before our predictions are accurate. We proceed by developing and analyzing idealized mathematical models that display the key features and complexity of real physical systems, but still simple enough that they can be studied mathematically. Very often, our models are partial differential equations with stochastic coefficients--that is, the underlying microscopic behavior of the system is assumed to be random--and the goal is to understand the statistics of the system. Our objective is to develop mathematical approaches that are (i) informed by the physics of the systems, (ii) robust--they can help us solve a variety of other, similar problems arising in, for example, statistical physics and probability theory, and (iii) quantitative--they lead to quantitative estimates of the uncertainty and insight into the development of numerical algorithms for simulation and prediction.

It is therefore important to understand precisely how well the homogenized equation approximates the true equation, and this is the goal of homogenization theory. Mathematicians have recently developed a complete quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for elliptic equations, and this theory has already been shown to have some surprising and important applications to probability theory and statistical mechanics. The present project aims to continue in this direction, by applying and developing homogenization techniques for gradient lattice models and related models in statistical physics, to the study of hypoelliptic diffusions arising in kinetic theory (modeling gases and plasmas) and toward understanding the behavior of diffusions forced by random vector fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.764649868011475, \"y\": 9.30491828918457}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"High-Performance Intelligent Data-Science Institute (HIDI)\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"HBCU-RISE: High-Performance Intelligent Data-Science Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering program supports the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines.

These changes can affect the extent of boreal wetlands as well as their ability to sequester and transform C and other nutrients. In 2005, the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) was created to examine the role of changing soil climate and vegetation on peatland C cycling. Over the past fifteen years, core data has been collected on soil moisture and temperature, plant composition and amount, and the fluxes of important atmospheric gases emitted (as methane and carbon dioxide) from water table treatments that simulate floods and droughts. A key result from this group's prior investigations was that C emissions from this experimental site appeared to be high, regardless of water table position, revealing that interactions among changes in plant species composition in response to the treatments were strongly controlling the ability of this ecosystem to retain C.  This is a five-year renewal of a Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) project, DEB-1354370. The study is examining the interactions among changes in hydrology, plant species composition and changes in climate (particularly flooding and drought) in controlling C storage in this peatland complex; this work is necessary for understanding the consequences of an altered climate for C cycle processes.  Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will all be trained and in field and laboratory techniques. Results from the research will also be incorporated into new high school curricula for use in the Fostering Science summer camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current view of peatland carbon cycling is that the majority of soil carbon mineralization occurs in the relatively shallow aerated peat layer above the water table (acrotelm), and that deeper peat carbon occurring in anoxic layers (catotelm) undergoes minimal decomposition. As such, the position of the water table (and the associated thickness of the acrotelm) is used as a predictor of overall decomposition rates and long-term peat accumulation rates. However, findings from this team's fifteen-year manipulation of water table position in an Alaskan fen (Alaska Peatland Experiment, APEX) challenge this view, and in particular suggest that carbon mineralization in saturated peat is faster than previously expected, leading to high fluxes of anaerobic CO2 production. Prior analyses indicated no significant effect of water table position on ecosystem respiration, but it is possible that this result was due at least partially to changes in vegetation that have occurred both under lower (drier) and higher (wetter) water table positions. The initial experimental design could not disentangle the effects of changes in vegetation from hydrology on peat redox and C fluxes. As such, understanding the interactive effects of altered hydrology and vegetation on anaerobic decomposition processes, and how this governs the turnover of deep soil C pools in peatlands, was the prime objective of the first phase of LTREB funding. Results during that initial LTREB funding period showed that sedge and Equisetum (horsetail) rhizospheres indeed had oxidizing effects on peat and dissolved organic matter. However, persistent flooding over this period of research has presented key gaps in mechanistic understanding of controls on trace gas production in this system, and revealed that plant community structure and the dominance of algae likely have unique controls on soil redox processes and C fluxes. Flooding history also exerted strong control over the relative activity of algae vs. heterotrophic microorganisms, depending on changes in C substrates from different plants. Exactly how changes in plant community interact with altered water tables in governing the supply of electron donors and acceptors, and how this controls anaerobic metabolism in low- and high-water table years, are key questions this collaborative team will examine in the next five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.229640483856201, \"y\": 5.607166767120361}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Increasing Student Success in Community College Mathematics through Active Learning and Systemic Instructional Change\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project aims to serve the national need for increasing the entry and success of community college students in college-level mathematics courses.

Examples of such problems include scheduling in a building with multiple elevators, managing a team for fire and rescue operations, managing the inventory of a large company, controlling a robotic soccer team, and controlling a robotic team to manage shelving and orders in a warehouse environment. These problems naturally fit into a formulation as discrete-time central-control problems where we design an algorithm that decides what action each agent takes at any time step in order to optimize the common objective. The corresponding computational problem, known as stochastic planning, is challenging due its sheer size. In particular, the number of possible states (for example, possible positions of robots, shelves and merchandise in a warehouse) and the number of possible joint actions (combinations of actions of individual robots) are huge in any problem instance of interest. State of the art approaches typically fail due to requiring too much time to properly search for a good policy or due to requiring too much memory to store intermediate values. By viewing stochastic planning through the lens of probabilistic inference, this project proposes several novel domain independent algorithmic approaches that take advantage of problem structure to calculate approximate solutions effectively under time constraints. The project funds are largely devoted to support training and research of PhD students therefore directly support human development in an important high impact area for the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More concretely, we propose three competing approaches to solving such problems, all taking insight from formulating the finite horizon control problem as probabilistic inference in a corresponding graphical model, also known as a dynamic Bayesian network. The first approach uses the idea of Monte Carlo search, but adds a strong symbolic component by introducing aggregate trajectories. Aggregate trajectories are obtained by simulating a compositional symbolic model under independence assumptions over the random variables. Each aggregate trajectory provides a value estimate that is approximate but can replace numerous individual trajectories. In this way we get fast approximation of values and effective control under time constraints. The second approach uses problem structure to translate the inference problem into an integer linear program, where the objective and quality of the solution can be traded-off for speed through problem  decomposition. A novel construction shows how to sidestep the exponential complexity of the problem and obtain a sequence of integer programs that are both small and decomposable so as to yield effective control under time constraints. The third approach, or more accurately framework, builds on the tight connection between stochastic planning and probabilistic inference in the corresponding dynamic Bayesian network. We show that variants of the first two approaches can be viewed in this light, and through this we propose new inference algorithms for solving the stochastic planning problem. In addition, based on this analysis, we propose  new algorithms for probabilistic inference, and new generalized inference questions that go beyond current research on marginal map in graphical models.\", \"x\": 4.589229106903076, \"y\": 9.012950897216797}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"EAGER: Investigating the Hinge Mechanics of the Spike Protein to Understand the Coronavirus Infection Mechanism\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This COVID-19 EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will investigate how SARS-CoV-2, virus causing the disease, attaches to cells, and how it may detach when subject to mechanical force.

However, both the computing industry and semiconductor technology are at a cross-roads, and new approaches are needed to sustain the historical trend of performance increases and overcome the barriers faced by conventional approaches to improving processor performance. A promising approach employed in recent designs has been to integrate function-specific hardware accelerators next to the processor, enabling efficient and high-performance offloading of common, coarse-grained, compute-intensive operations\\u2014such as decoding of video data\\u2014from the general-purpose CPU. This project will explore an emerging variant of this approach, where the accelerators are designed to perform frequent, fine-grained operations, are coupled tightly to the processor core, and are expected to be more flexible, broadly applicable, and easier to integrate into the software development model familiar to the vast majority of today\\u2019s programmers. This research is expected to lead to several practical artifacts along with scientific and conceptual advances that will enable designers of future microprocessors to more easily integrate such accelerators, as well as preparation and training of graduate students with potential for direct technology transfer through their future employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to conduct a detailed study of tightly-coupled accelerators (TCAs), uncovering the trade-offs and complexities of integrating them into modern processors. To date, little has been done to characterize and optimize the many design considerations that can have critical impact on overall processor performance and power consumption. The project will approach this problem in three phases. The initial phase will develop an analytical model for assessing the impact of integrating TCAs in high-performance CPUs. Next, a comprehensive study of the microarchitectural implications of TCAs will uncover key design challenges, opportunities, and novel solutions for integrating TCAs. The final phase will investigate reconfigurable TCAs, which are intended to achieve the seemingly contradictory goals of specialized acceleration as well as broad applicability. The project will investigate several avenues for general-purpose acceleration using our reconfigurable TCA architecture, showing that it is possible to reap the best of both worlds of specialization and generalization without dedicating significant hardware real estate nor design effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.307302951812744, \"y\": 9.747905731201172}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"COVID-Inspired Data Science Education through Epidemiology\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic provides a starting point for empowering young people to understand uses of data science through epidemiology.

The timing and duration of early egg development determines the number of eggs produced and the number of seasonal spawning events a female can undergo. The research team will use samples of Antarctic krill collected over the last 30 years in late winter/early spring, summer and early fall. The reproductive development stages of individual females in these samples will be assessed. These data will be modeled against climatological and oceanographic data to test three hypotheses.

Through this project, graduate students will be trained to test, characterize, model and predict the mechanical behavior of transition metal carbides.

This project investigates how this chemistry, and specifically the order of the carbon atoms, controls the mechanical mechanisms responsible for peculiar anomalous hardening and low temperature creep in these carbides. The experimental and computational research develops synergic support in elucidating the fundamental mechanics of dislocations in these ceramics relative to temperature, chemistry, and most importantly, the order of the non-metal sublattice. This project provides, for the first time, a description of the mechanical properties in terms of chemical order using the order parameter. This project is particularly relevant now given the importance of these materials for use in the energy, aerospace, and defense industries, especially the area of applied hypersonics. Furthermore, understanding the mechanistic link for such mechanical properties will aid the development of new compositionally complex transition metal carbides.

Conditions for static liquefaction (sudden loss of stability even in the absence of extreme events such as earthquakes) on these materials cannot be evaluated using known engineering procedures. This research will create new knowledge for improving resilient design of tailings storage facilities against static liquefaction and provide insights into creating new design protocols to mitigate potential disasters in the United States and worldwide that are induced by the static liquefaction of mine tailings.

Bacterial pathogens often share beneficial genetic material amongst themselves, enabling them to quickly adapt to their surroundings. The process of sharing genetic material, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), is the most common way that bacteria rapidly adapt to diverse environments. While much focus has been placed on characterizing pathogens that have already acquired beneficial traits via HGT, relatively little is known about the immediate adaptation that cells must undergo to successfully acquire such traits. This project investigates the adaptation process following HGT to provide insights into why certain pathogens are more successful (and therefore, prevalent) than others.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the plasmid fitness cost as a determinant of plasmid-strain success: strains bearing high-cost plasmids are either out-competed or evolve compensatory mutations that ameliorate the plasmid's metabolic burden. In addition to the fitness cost, acquiring a plasmid introduces an immediate, but transient, disruption to metabolism which also impacts population growth dynamics. The impacts of these short-term effects remain an understudied feature of conjugation dynamics. This project synergistically leverages longitudinal transcriptomics, computational modeling, and whole-genome sequencing to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of this acquisition cost. In so doing, the project directly connects gene expression patterns, arising as a consequence of plasmid acquisition, to their population-level effects. The first objective elucidates the mechanistic determinants that lead to plasmid acquisition cost for the representative plasmid RP4, using a combination of transcriptomics, genetic/biochemical validation, and metabolic network modeling.

Carbon is in all living things, the ocean, the earth, and the atmosphere. Increasing carbon in the atmosphere has led to climate change, which has had major effects across the globe. One effect has been increasing wildfires in northern ecosystems. In these ecosystems, large amounts of carbon are stored in soils. This carbon can be stored for a long time and is sometimes very old. Wildfires that burn these soils can release this old carbon to the atmosphere and cause more climate warming. This project will determine where and when this old carbon is burning. This information will help us understand how increasing wildfires will affect future climate. It will also help fire managers set priorities for where to fight fires. We will share our results with rural northern communities near our research sites and with citizens and youth of Northern Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate how increasing wildfires will impact the long-term carbon storage of Arctic ecosystems. Arctic ecosystems store over 40% of terrestrial carbon and have historically been considered carbon sinks. This means they store more carbon than they lose to the atmosphere. Carbon in these ecosystems is primarily stored in soils for long periods, sometimes centuries. Periodic wildfires release some soil carbon to the atmosphere. Any soil carbon that escapes burning in a previous fire is called 'legacy carbon.' Due to climate warming, wildfires have increased in frequency and severity in northern ecosystems. More severe and frequent wildfires can combust legacy carbon and shift Arctic ecosystems from a carbon sink to a carbon source to the atmosphere. The main objective of this research is to determine the processes that control legacy carbon combustion. Understanding where and when legacy carbon combustion is likely to occur is essential for predicting how frequently Arctic ecosystems will shift from a carbon sink to a carbon source. These results will benefit global stakeholders, including policymakers, by improving our understanding of the mechanisms through which environmental change affects the global carbon cycle and climate.

Results will be communicated with policymakers, along with scientific and public audiences, in order to have a real-time impact on the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will consider compartmental outbreak models of COVID-19 with responsive quarantine, tracing and social distancing measures. The novel formulation allows for derivation of outbreak size, dependent on contact tracing and broad quarantine intervention parameters. Reproduction number estimates and model fitting of case, tracing and quarantine data will quantify region-specific control characteristics. Sensitivity of epidemic size to combinations of contact tracing and social distancing measures will be assessed to understand viable strategies for flattening and shrinking epidemic curves. Long term scenarios of loosening and tightening of quarantine interventions for sustainable control will be investigated through analysis and simulation of the models. In addition, through interdisciplinary collaboration, the researchers will incorporate multi-region stochastic versions of the epidemiological models with phylodynamic computations of genomic data to improve model projections in the presence of possible unknown chains of transmission and area-specific responsive interventions. A \\u201cforward simulation-backward coalescent\\u201d approach will track migration events and produce phylogenetic tree signatures for matching model simulations to phylogenetic data. The overall combined phylodynamic and epidemic model analysis will quantify heterogeneous disease spread and contact-based control efficacy to inform public health authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.541748523712158, \"y\": 6.19804573059082}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Sensitivity of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to 2\\u00b0 Celsius (SWAIS 2C)\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). The West Antarctic Ice Sheet presently holds enough ice that it would raise global sea level by five meters if it all melted. Information from satellites demonstrates that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing ice faster than any other region in the Antarctic. However, how much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will melt and how quickly it will happen when average global temperatures exceed 2 degrees C is currently unknown. At the current rate of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, average global temperatures will be 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C above preindustrial levels in 10 and 20 years, respectively. Virtually all pathways to restrict the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees C now require direct carbon removal from the atmosphere. Sea level rise is one of the clearest planet-wide signals of this human-induced climate change. Global mean sea level has increased by ~22 cm since 1880 and will continue to rise well beyond the 21st century. Given the far-reaching and international consequences of Antarctica's future contribution to global sea level rise, the SWAIS 2C Project was developed through international collaboration to better forecast the size and timing of future changes. The Sensitivity of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to 2\\u2070 Celsius (SWAIS 2C) Project scientists will collect and study geological (rocks), glaciological (ice), and geophysical (Earth physical properties) data and provide new information to guide the development of climate and ice sheet numerical models to better understand and predict how the ice sheet on West Antarctica will contribute to future sea level rise. The project aims to interpret the state of past environmental conditions in West Antarctica (warm open marine seas, cold ice-covered ocean, or polar grounded ice sheet) during recent periods in Earths history when average global temperatures reached or exceeded 2 degrees C, levels anticipated within the next two decades. These types of geological studies will help us understand how much ice melted during past warm periods, what processes are involved, and how fast it will change. Glaciological and geophysical information collected by scientists will help us better understand the modern processes that cause the ice sheet to grow or melt. Modeling studies will use this new information regarding past and present ice sheet behavior to make better predictions of how much and how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will melt in the future. This project will support a United States scientific team with a range of scientific expertise, with a key goal of broadening the involvement of early career scientists in Antarctic research. Informative and impactful education and outreach materials will be developed and shared with educators to bring polar science into the classroom and provide accurate information related to ice sheets stability, sea level rise, and global climate change to students and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Satellite observations show that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is losing mass at an accelerated rate, much faster than other Antarctic regions. WAIS is considered highly sensitive to future warming because much of it is grounded 2500 m below sea level and its associated floating ice shelves are exposed to warming ocean waters. Future collapse of marine-based sectors and full melting of the WAIS has the potential to raise global mean sea level by 5 meters. However, Antarctic ice sheet dynamics remain the largest uncertainty in numerical model projections of future sea level rise. Existing datasets lack direct physical evidence of WAISs response to past times when global mean temperatures were 2 degrees C warmer than during pre-industrial time. The Sensitivity of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to 2\\u2070 Celsius (SWAIS 2C) project is a four-year project developed through international collaboration to integrate geological, glaciological, and geophysical data with ice sheet and climate modeling studies to better project future scenarios of WAIS contribution to sea level rise. This approach will aim to integrate studies of past (using geological records) and present (using glaciology and geophysical records) ice sheet behavior to inform future projections (using models) of WAIS response to climate change. This project will recover two ~200 m-long sediment cores from beneath the WAIS using new drilling technology in strategic locations adjacent to the grounding zone at Kamb Ice Stream and at Crary Ice Rise in the inner Ross Embayment along the Siple Coast. Three SWAIS 2C approaches will determine conditions associated with past WAIS collapses and will sharpen our predictive tools to assess its future stability in our warming world: (1) stratigraphic records will provide new paleoenvironmental information regarding past sensitivities to system boundaries, processes, and rates of change; (2) modern observations will provide details of the variables and complexities associated with processes and rates of change; and (3) numerical model application and development will assess future scenarios to equilibrium states in accelerated time, and test system sensitivities and feedbacks.  SWAIS 2C Project results will contribute new information from the southern end (most proximal to the ice grounding zone) of a transect that extends north to recent drill holes in the outer Ross Embayment to connect with distal Southern Ocean records. The SWAIS 2C Project is complementary to the US-UK Thwaites Glacier Project on the other side of West Antarctica, allowing for a broader understanding of WAIS history and more accurate predictions of future change. A major goal of this project is to broaden development of early-career scientists in polar research and work closely with teaching professionals to provide new, impactful, and assessable classroom material to educators, and accurate information related to ice sheets stability, sea level rise, and global climate change to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.9476728439331055, \"y\": 5.695639133453369}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"RUI: Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Dynamics for Systems of Physical Origin\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"In dynamical systems, systems that change with time such as planetary motion, much of the research is focused on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained. In many modeling situations, however, such a global view is not possible and it becomes necessary to study systems that are influenced by other unknown systems, possibly on different scales. This project will investigate properties of chaotic dynamical systems that are out of equilibrium, either due to the application of external forces or because mass or energy is allowed to escape.  Systems to be studied during the course of this project include systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms, and large-scale systems of smaller interacting components that exchange mass or energy.  These problems are strongly motivated by connections with statistical mechanics and seek to advance our understanding of fundamental questions related to energy transport and diffusion.  This project will also support the involvement of undergraduate students in mathematics research.  The highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems outlined above will enable the principal investigator to recruit undergraduate students to participate in related research projects during the course of the project.  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting students from underrepresented groups in research mathematics.  Students will disseminate results of their research via poster sessions, conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, the grant will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivated by the problems outlined above, this project is organized around three specific projects:  The first project investigates the statistical and thermodynamic properties of both classical and non-equilibrium particle systems with collision interactions, an important class of models from statistical mechanics; the second concerns open systems, which relate on the one hand to physical systems in which mass or energy is allowed to escape, and on the other to the study of metastable states; the third project generalizes open systems to include linked and extended dynamical systems comprised of two or more components that exchange mass or energy through deterministic or random mechanisms.  Important examples include the aperiodic Lorentz gas and mechanical models of heat conduction.  The investigator will bring to bear several analytical techniques that he has been instrumental in developing for these classes of systems, including his recent work concerning the spectral decomposition of transfer operators for dispersing particle systems, contractions in projective cones due to Birkhoff, and the construction of adapted Markov extensions (a generalization of Markov partitions).  None of these techniques require Markovian assumptions on the dynamics, making them widely applicable to a wide variety of nonuniformly hyperbolic and physically important systems.  The application of these techniques to central models from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics will represent significant advances in the study of such systems.  Efforts to understand these tools in one context strengthens them and aids in their application to other areas of mathematics.  Their intellectual interest is enhanced by the application of these ideas to resolve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.275065898895264, \"y\": 9.17142391204834}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Implications of Solar Radiation Management for Strategic Behavior and Climate Governance\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"With recent scientific reports warning of serious global impacts if greenhouse gas emissions are not quickly curtailed, some nations or other entities may be inclined to pursue a technological climate management strategy that does not require international cooperation. Solar radiation management (SRM) is emerging as the leading candidate from among a variety of potential \\u201cgeoengineering\\u201d technologies. SRM seeks to increase the amount of sunlight reflected back into space to offset the heat-trapping effects of GHG emissions. One approach, which involves widespread release of reflective particles in the stratosphere, is expected to be especially cheap and fast\\u2010acting. This means that a single nation that is especially vulnerable to climate change may decide to deploy SRM, even if it is potentially detrimental to other nations. This research project is designed to investigate how the potential availability and implementation of geoengineering is likely to impact future climate action and impacts. The research team also explores the ways in which alternative international governance frameworks might promote strategies that lead to the greatest global benefit. The project advances existing theory and models of climate action by considering the potential evolution of decision making as climate change becomes more urgent and nations struggle to reach a cooperative solution. This theoretical advancement is reinforced by behavioral laboratory experiments as well as computer model simulations. By providing insight into the wider ramifications of geoengineering, The research is timely and socially relevant. Specifically, the researchers broaden the impact of the work via three main mechanisms: (i) Direct engagement of domestic and international climate policymakers, to improve mutual understanding of the implications of SRM; (ii) Translation and dissemination of our modeling and experimental tools and results for application to other problems in science and technology policy; (iii) Provision of socially relevant experiences for diverse students that develop their capacity to communicate with decision makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate change is a typical public goods problem, requiring collective action to successfully co-manage. Global collective action on climate change is a challenge, however, as each potential actor has an incentive to \\u201cfree\\u2010ride\\u201d on the actions of others. This leads to insufficient overall action \\u2013 the so\\u2010called \\u201ctragedy of the commons.\\u201d This situation may be transformed, however, by the potential of solar radiation management (SRM) as a non\\u2010cooperative climate change management strategy. In particular, the injection of reflective particles into the stratosphere may be a sufficiently cheap and easy means of cooling the earth to be feasibly implemented by a single nation. However, SRM is an imperfect solution as it is short\\u2010lived and has its own risks and governance challenges. In this project, we seek to understand the potential impacts of SRM on future climate management strategy, the prospects of cooperative action, and the role of international governance. Key research questions include: Under what conditions will SRM encourage free\\u2010riding, free\\u2010driving, or cooperation? Will nations reserve SRM as a last resort, or implement it before it is necessary? What role can SRM play in a climate management portfolio that includes mitigation and adaptation? How will heterogeneity among nations in their preference for SRM impact the potential for cooperation? How can international institutions rein in any free\\u2010driver impetus created by SRM while incentivizing cooperation? This project addresses these and other research questions by connecting theory, model simulation, and experiment in pursuit of three specific aims: 1. Develop and analyze a game theoretic model of the dynamics of international climate cooperation when some nations have the ability to implement SRM. 2. Design and implement experimental games that represent the key features of SRM to test the theoretic model against actual behavior and to inform development of an agent\\u2010based simulation. 3. Simulate and field test alternative&lt;br/&gt;frameworks for international governance and institutional design that promote climate strategies with the greatest social benefit. While our project is motivated by the prospect of SRM as a non\\u2010cooperative, short\\u2010term solution to climate change, insights from our project are potentially applicable to any situation in which a risky technology is being presented as a quick fix for problems traditionally addressed through collective action.

Nonetheless, the current understanding of global ocean activities and ocean health is extremely inadequate due to the lack of sufficient observation data below the ocean surface.  The gap between the large ocean volumes to explore and the number of existing sensors in subsurface regions remains astonishingly huge, leaving the majority of the oceans unexplored. Small-size autonomous underwater vehicles are becoming essential elements in persistent and pervasive ocean sensing and monitoring. Accurate localization is of utmost importance for these vehicles to perform intelligent sensing and control as well as for the users to properly interpret the vehicles' measurements. However, underwater localization is notoriously challenging since the ocean is opaque to radio frequency signals, rendering the satellite-based positioning systems unavailable underwater. To this end, this project will result in novel algorithms that enable teams of marine robots to persistently and collaboratively navigate the under-explored ocean volumes by utilizing ocean flows as localization references. This project will fundamentally increase the footprint and autonomy of mobile robots in fluid environments. The project outcomes will benefit several pertinent research areas including oceanography, marine ecology, and meteorology.

The goal is to decrease community spread of infection and help mitigate the negative economic impacts of world-wide pandemics. The proposed diagnostic may allow for universal access to testing of both coronavirus infection and immunity via protein-protein interactions with virions and antibodies at once as compared with using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test that relies on time-consuming reverse transcription of RNA to detect the virus only.  The consensus among public health experts is that safely emerging from a lockdown will require regular testing of millions of Americans. Current testing technologies are limited due to a large percentage of false negatives (up to 20%). Additionally, access to coronavirus and antibody testing is limited in low resource settings that lack reliable electrical services, running water, and diagnostic devices and personnel to operate them. Although testing capabilities are increasing among currently employed technologies such as at-home nasopharyngeal sampling, the creation of a rapid, simple POC test has not been addressed.

The hope is that quantum computers will eventually be able to efficiently simulate quantum physics and study many (important) computationally difficult problems inaccessible to modern-day computers. There are models such as the Quantum Gates Model that give theoretical constructions of efficient circuits to be used in quantum computers. This model is connected to the study of integral solutions to Diophantine equations, an ancient subject of interest to mathematicians. A question of interest to both quantum computer scientists as well as mathematicians is the optimal approximation of real solutions of special Diophantine equations by integral solutions. The PI has proved new (optimal) results in this direction. Furthermore, he has proved that this task is computationally hard (NP-complete) for generic inputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a more technical level, one of the central problems in the Quantum Gates Model is the approximation of an arbitrary qubit using a fixed set of generators called universal quantum gates. In the single-qubit case, this amounts to navigating the unitary group SU(2) by a specific set of topological generators (e.g. V-gates or the Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak generators) that are carefully chosen such that the associated transition matrix has the optimal spectral gap (e.g. the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators satisfy the Ramanujan bound). The PI proposes a refinement of the Ross and Selinger algorithm for approximating an arbitrary single-qubit that removes all heuristic assumptions from their algorithm. Among the new tools in this approach are the delta method, Sieve theory, and the spectral theory of modular forms and bounds on their Fourier coefficients. An objective of this project is to generalize the results of the PI to higher rank arithmetic groups which brings in the theory of the oscillator representation and the theory of automorphic representations. Motivated by Berry's conjecture in Quantum Chaos, the PI studies the statistical properties and the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix of the quantum gates (the Hecke operators). So far, the PI has proved power saving upper bounds as well as absolute upper bound on the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators. Furthermore, the PI has proved lower bounds on the discrepancy of the spectral measure with respect to the Plancherel measure.

A recent U.S. Department of Energy report stated that as much as 5.9 billion gallons of biocrude could be produced each year in the U.S. from the available waste organic matter using HTL technology; this biocrude can be further refined to liquid transportation fuels using processes similar to conventional petroleum refining, replacing those fuels currently produced from non-renewable feedstocks. However, current HTL processes produce a large amount of wastewater containing high concentrations of organic compounds and nutrients; the sustainable disposal of this wastewater is one of the most significant bottlenecks to the scale-up and commercialization of HTL. This research will address concerns from both environmental and energy conversion efficiency perspectives of HTL by recovering organic carbon and nutrients from HTL wastewater. This is a critical step to increasing the net energy yield and enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of HTL processes. In the course of carrying out this project, the researchers will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in biofuel production, biotechnology/bioprocessing, and environmental stewardship, all while educating the public about sustainable biofuel production and the impact of energy consumption on economic, environmental and societal sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team of this proposal has recently found that a marine protist Thraustochytrium striatum HB can survive and grow in wastewater produced from HTL processing of municipal solid waste without supplemental nutrients while removing approximately 80% total organic carbon, 100% total nitrogen, and 80% phosphorus. Additionally, the microbes were found to be tolerant of wide pH and salinity ranges (comparable to sea water) in metabolizing organic compounds in HTL wastewater while being able to form cell aggregates under harsh conditions. Therefore, marine protists hold promise to be a new class of superior microorganisms for HTL wastewater treatment and valorization. The overarching goal of this project is to establish a T. striatum HB-facilitated platform for HTL wastewater valorization to enable sustainable HTL for biofuel production. The specific objectives of this research are to: (1) elucidate the correlation between biocrude yield and the HTL wastewater composition; (2) reveal the metabolic adaptation of T. striatum HB to the new wastewater environments to enhance overall energy return and biocrude yield; and (3) explore the formation mechanisms of T. striatum HB biogranules and the resulting performance impact on HTL wastewater valorization since biogranules are more efficient in wastewater valorization compared to dispersed cells. The marine protists could be a new class of promising microorganisms for valorization of other types of high-strength wastewater.

We are now on the cusp of widespread adoption of 5G technology. While 5G is widely marketed for its gigabit per second rates and ultra-low latency, it also fundamentally changes the internal network architecture, providing dynamic provisioning of software-defined services that offer enhanced control to network tenants including virtual operators and enterprises. However, these major architectural changes expose 5G systems to new adversaries and threats, and the ability to reason about the many technical components that comprise these systems is critical. The goal of this work is to aid mobile network operators in deploying cellular systems that are assured to be secure, through the development of tools and techniques that extract, model, and analyze the security-sensitive logic of the source and binary code existing within the cellular network infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to address the broad research challenge of translating security-critical requirements of cellular network infrastructure into program analysis tools to assess those requirements for a given implementation. Rather than strictly identifying traditional software flaws (e.g., memory safety), this project focuses on the discovery of logic vulnerabilities within three key aspects: cryptographic protocols, access control, and core functionality. Each aspect presents unique challenges and opportunities to advance the state-of-the-art. While prior work has studied the cellular cryptographic protocols themselves, vulnerabilities can emerge when developers fail to correctly implement assumptions made by formal proofs (e.g., secure randomness and verification of cryptographic values). Simultaneously, the disaggregation of traditional cellular system components into microservices running in cloud environments increases the attack surface for core functionality, particularly as the number and complexity of network tenants grows. As such, specification and enforcement of access control between 5G core network functions is critical to the security of the deployment. Finally, every computing system represents an ecosystem of software components and dependencies. Backdoors and logic bombs can have significant consequences when they exist within such critical infrastructure. This project will assess these considerations within a combination of open source and proprietary 5G implementations and generalize the knowledge for assessment of implementations deployed by cellular providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.4676194190979, \"y\": 9.213614463806152}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"RUI: Investigating Spin Currents from Nuclear Field Gradients\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research into spin and charge current generation relevant to future \\\"spintronics\\\" technologies, educating wider student populations about the quantum mechanics of spin, and outreach to local communities on issues pertaining to quantum science.  Familiar electronics is based on a current of charges.  Spintronics works, instead, on a current of magnetic spins, which one can think of as infinitesimal bar magnets.  Efficiently generating and measuring spin currents is a condition for many proposed spin-based devices. The research effort will theoretically investigate a mechanism of spin-current generation and measurement that involves non-uniform magnetic fields coming from atomic nuclei embedded in a semiconductor.  A further goal of this activity will be to compare figures of merit of this new mechanism to traditional spin-orbit coupling for spin-current generation and detection. Students will take part in all aspects of the project: learning and applying analytic and numerical methods, drafting articles, and presenting results at meetings.  The principal investigator (PI) will develop course materials for an introductory class in the quantum mechanics of spin that will be geared toward a wide swath of students: those who have not taken traditional quantum mechanics or even many upper-level physics courses. The curriculum will be designed to be accessible to chemistry and engineering/computer science students in an effort to mainstream quantum mechanical and quantum computing concepts.  Quantum technologies are expected to bring about a quantum revolution. The PI will engage the campus and local community in discussions (through public presentations) of quantum science, the directions quantum technology will lead, and the importance of quantum education for the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical investigations of spin-current-to-charge-current and charge-current-to-spin-current conversion by means of gradients in nuclear field. The spin-Hall effect and its inverse effect are presently the chief methods by which spin/charge currents are converted.  Spin-Hall conversions require materials with strong spin-orbit interactions, which shorten spin diffusion lengths. The research thrust here is to tap into alternative materials for charge/spin current conversion where strong spin-orbit interactions are not necessary or desirable; instead, strong hyperfine interactions are relied upon.  Nuclear field or hyperfine gradients offer a mechanism by which either spin or charge current can be generated. Spin separation via this nuclear gradient channel is reminiscent of the Stern-Gerlach effect, but since the nuclear field is not a true magnetic field in the sense of a Lorentz force being operational, spins are able to separate more effectively than they would in a true magnetic field gradient (the nuclear field - at the level of the Fermi contact potential - acts only on the spin and not on the orbital degree of freedom). The project goal is to develop and solve spin and charge drift-diffusion equations with the gradient effect included. Analytic solutions are possible for some configurations but in general the coupled equations are nonlinear and necessitate numerical methods. Furthermore, two possible experimental realizations of the effect will be modeled: electrical spin injection and optical spin injection. In both situations, a nuclear gradient is feasible through non-uniform dynamic nuclear polarization by injected spin polarized carriers. By modeling and evaluating these scenarios, a guide will be provided to experimentalists who wish to observe the spin and charge separating effects. Ultimately, the spin/charge drift diffusion formalism developed will be able to incorporate other types of field gradients as well, namely, spin-orbit fields such as those due to the Rashba interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.332259178161621, \"y\": 8.521303176879883}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Group Actions on Trees and Boundaries of Trees\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Geometric group theory connects two foundational fields of mathematics, namely group theory and geometry.  A group can be thought of as the set of symmetries of an object such as a water molecule or a Rubik's Cube.  A single group can represent the symmetries of many geometric or topological spaces.  If the chosen space is nice enough and can be sufficiently well understood, the characteristics of the spaces can reveal properties inherent to the group.  One can take the opposite approach as well.  Often one can detect properties of a topological or geometric space by studying groups which describe their symmetries.  This project aims to explore these connections between groups and the spaces on which they act.  Broader impacts of the project include continued mentoring through various programs and networks, public outreach for middle and high school students, and dissemination of knowledge through conference organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is primarily on groups acting on infinite trees and on boundaries of infinite trees.  This includes large classes of groups; for instance it contains all residually finite groups but also many of the known examples of infinite simple groups.  The first goal of the project is to extend the PI's past work to better understand the universe of infinite simple groups.  The last 10 years have seen an influx of new and surprising theorems illuminating the understanding of the variety of groups in this class.  The PI will study groups in the extended Thompson family using their partial actions on a rooted tree, their full action on the Stein-Farley complex, and their embeddings into the homeomorphism group of the Cantor space.  The second goal of the project is to better understand branch and automata groups.  Over the last forty years, this class of groups has served as a rich source of exotic yet tractable groups.  The PI will use automata theory to investigate questions of growth and torsion and apply the long developed theory of branch groups to work towards a general theory of maximal subgroups of branch groups. The final focus of the project is on group properties coming from topological constructions.  The PI will develop a geometric group theory analog of the topological theory of branch coverings as well as explore connections between the general theory of homological stability and topological finiteness properties, first through certain natural subgroups of some big mapping class groups by exploiting actions on highly connected complexes related to the curve complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.087057590484619, \"y\": 9.874755859375}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (Renewal): Promoting Cybersecurity Excellence and Diversity via Dynamic and Applied Learning Tactics\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project supports continuation of the CyberCorps\\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB).

NMOs play integral parts in how microorganisms make numerous natural compounds for a variety of purposes.  These compounds can also have useful bioactivities that benefit society.  While many flavin-dependent enzymes are well known and have been thoroughly characterized, the NMOs are a relatively recently discovered branch on the family tree, and do not resemble the other members in common ways.  This leads to the hypothesis that new and interesting structures and chemistries are likely to be at play in the reactions catalyzed by the NMOs.  The investigators choose several examples of NMOs for in depth examination in order to compare and contrast their behaviors.  Further, a highly multidisciplinary approach is proposed to provide the broadest possible understanding of the enzymes.  The proposed experimental approach will provide a platform for the training of undergraduate and graduate students in modern enzymology and biophysical chemistry.

Prior research has demonstrated that these learning experiences and other specific program factors promote gains in important skills and content knowledge along with science affinity, STEM career interest, computer affinity and science identity, especially for youth from groups historically underrepresented in STEM.

Recruited educators will be randomly assigned to one of four different conditions of initial PD training, implementation coaching by peer leaders, and access to STEM expertise, with decreasing involvement of the project team. This tests how different strategies for educator PD promote (or inhibit) the successful adoption and integration of a technology-rich learning innovation into different settings, and to examine the conditions under which YouthAstroNet is most impactful on student and educator outcomes. The project aims to answer the following research questions: 1) Does a focused version of the YouthAstroNet intervention, optimized for scale-up, produce equal or better results (as measured by student and teacher outcomes) than the original project? 2) How do student experiences, teacher practices, and student and teacher outcomes differ between the YouthAstroNet program and other STEM programs of similar duration? 3) How do student experiences, teacher practices, and student and teacher outcomes differ between novice educators and those who have previously participated in the program? 4) Under which conditions of PD support is the intervention most successful in producing gains in STEM interest, identity and career interest \\u2013 especially for female and underrepresented minority students? Research instruments include previously validated pre- and post-surveys for students that measure STEM knowledge, interest, affinity, and identity, along with online participation analytics.

They are extremely sensitive to environmental changes, e.g. sea-level rise, sediment and water supply, and therefore communities that rely on the resources of these dynamic and sensitive landscapes are at risk. The past dynamics of deltas are partially preserved in their sedimentary records, and these records represent valuable templates for testing predictive models of future change. To understand these systems, the researchers propose to create a predictive framework that enables them to relate the arrangement of channels and floodplains on the surface of deltas to the record of past dynamics preserved in their sediments. Much like river deltas, the earth science field also needs to be responsive to changing demographics in the scientific community through strategic distribution of resources and opportunities. This project provides support for underrepresented minority lead scientists, early career investigators, and inclusive research experiences for students, allowing the researchers to leverage the knowledge and experience that comes from a diverse research team. The framework of support proposed here could be a valuable template for creating a more diverse and inclusive scientific community, particularly in earth science, which continues to have the lowest (9%) rates of ethnic and racial diversity of all other STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Records of past environmental states contained within the sedimentary deposits of river deltas, while amongst the most complete on Earth, are extremely challenging to decipher.  The premise of the proposed research is that the sedimentary record of deltaic systems is mediated by a combination of their autogenic dynamics (e.g. avulsion and lateral migration rates) and allogenic forcings (e.g. climate, tectonics, sea level).  The researchers propose to develop an integrated statistical framework to characterize deltaic transport systems and their sedimentary records across a range of spatial and temporal scales. To construct this framework, they will iterate between data from physical and numerical experiments, and field data-sets, providing quantitative constraints on scale-dependent dynamics and their contribution to filtering signals stored in the subsurface sedimentary record.

Small length scales are important for products such as sensors, electronics, and medical diagnostic devices which are becoming miniaturized and portable. Further, most additive manufacturing methods are tailored for fabrication of parts containing a single material and are not well-suited for parts combining multiple different materials.

The ability to additively manufacture microscale parts with tailored composition will enable advances in areas such as healthcare, chemical and biomedical sensing, and energy storage. This research will use techniques from multiple different fields of study, including chemistry, materials science, optics, mechanics, and thermal modeling, to tackle the manufacturing challenges from a range of angles.

For example, in the question \\u201cWho do you think the bill will help?\\u201d, \\u201cwho\\u201d should be interpreted as the object of \\u201chelp\\u201d even though it is pronounced many words, and several seconds, earlier.

For the language that encodes animacy grammatically, two comprehension studies will be used to trace the incremental comprehension of relative clauses involving co-arguments of differing animacies.

This project seeks to quantify the wave-dependent drag forces and associated hydrodynamic mechanisms by which giant kelp mediates flow conditions in inner shelf habitats. The frictional drag generated by individual kelp plants and whole kelp forests strongly influence circulation and transport in coastal habitats. However, at present it is not possible to incorporate these effects into coastal circulation models. High-resolution field measurements will be used to develop parameterizations of drag on a whole kelp forest in the presence of coastal currents, surface waves, and internal waves, that will be suitable for use in inner shelf circulation models. The analysis will seek to quantify the magnitude by which kelp forests affect cross-shore exchange on the inner shelf and to determine the mechanisms that mitigate cross-shore exchange in the presence of kelp so that the findings may be generalized to any kelp forest environment. This is relevant to understanding coastal environmental flows and their interactions with a range of types of aquatic vegetation in both natural systems and for large-scale aquaculture and ecosystem management. Understanding their hydrodynamics is thus important to management of coastal waters, as well as to designing natural restoration areas and potential aquaculture systems. Given the rapid development in high resolution circulation models as decision-analysis tools for coastal zone management, including the potentially large hydrodynamic effects of kelp forests can be an essential prerequisite to producing accurate predictions of inner shelf flows. Thus, one particular focus of the project will be to develop a new model for kelp drag in terms of mean currents and wave velocities incorporating simple measures of kelp configuration and biomass that can be used in coastal circulation models. Given the fundamental roles hydrodynamics play in shaping kelp forest ecology through its effects on biogeochemistry and on the transport of larvae, advancing our understanding of kelp forest hydrodynamics will be of use to a wide range of researchers and resource agencies. Moreover, given the large body of ongoing work focused on the Pt. Loma kelp forest, as well as its fundamental importance to the California coastal ocean due to its large size, the results of this study should be of particular use to local scientists and managers. Accordingly, the data collected will also be archived on SCOOS servers as well as on the NODC database. The project will also support graduate education, post-doctoral professional development, and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central theme of the project will be to quantify depth-dependent drag associated with flow imposed on flexible vegetative structures \\u2013 kelp plants in currents and waves \\u2013 where the movement of the kelp is both influenced by, and in turn mediates, the overall hydrodynamic conditions. Thus, the research will delineate mechanisms of the complex feedbacks between environmental flows and aquatic vegetation that can span the entire water column. While past studies in the field and in the lab have examined elements of this interaction, e.g. changes in mean flows or wave velocity fields by kelp, this study will provide a holistic view of kelp forest hydrodynamics particularly including motion of the kelp. Whereas, in previous field studies kelp drag has always been estimated in ad hoc ways, here it will be measured directly. Quantitative analysis of field observations will test three key hypotheses: (1) Movement of the plants in the presence of waves and sheltering effects that develop when kelp-plant density is sufficiently high are O(1) determinants of mean drag. This hypothesis implies that drag of a whole kelp forest is not a simple linear function of the number of individual kelp plants, but depends on interactions between scale and spacing of individual drag elements and their movement in imposed flows. (2) Wave-current interactions and frequency dependent radiation stress alter the flow field in and around kelp forests. These flow effects along with damping of high frequency internal waves and internal tides and increased diurnal thermal stratification imply that (3a) the presence of a kelp forest can locally enhance cross-shore exchange between the kelp forest and the offshore ocean environment and (3b) a kelp forest acts as a partial barrier that reduces transport between the offshore region and the very near shore region inshore of the kelp. The latter hypothesis predicts the presence of kelp forests can have important consequences for altering circulation and residence time near shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.90550422668457, \"y\": 5.631500244140625}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"\\\"Engaging with Community for Undergraduate Student Success in Mathematics, Engineering and Science\\\"\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at the University of San Diego.

Student majors will include behavioral neuroscience, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, environmental and ocean sciences, mathematics, and/or physics. The entering first-year Scholars will be recruited from partnering community organizations that serve populations of students who are eligible for the S-STEM program. The project aims to increase the success of these Scholars by leveraging community engagement, along with individualized faculty mentoring. Scholars will also have opportunities such as access to research experiences and internships, and to community- and career-building activities. The project seeks to advance knowledge about the effectiveness of these activities on students' sense of belonging and STEM self-efficacy. The project will create and assess the effectiveness of institutional changes in the admissions process and institutional supports for the Scholars.  Examples of notable institutional supports include development of a \\\"Flourishing in STEM\\\" student success course and a \\\"Changemaking in STEM\\\" course to encourage scholars to apply their STEM knowledge to issues affecting their communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is centered on a mutually-beneficial and equitable collaboration between the University and community partners that will benefit the scholars, the community, and the University, and advance understanding of how a community-based approach, including meaningful community engagement, affects the scholars' persistence and success in STEM.

East Africa is the prime example of present-day continental rifting. While a number of studies have yielded important insights in the older, more developed rifts in northern East Africa, there are major gaps in our knowledge of how rifting begins and develops due to sparse data in the younger Western and Southwestern rift systems. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about how far ground deformation related to early-stage rifting extends across the region and to what extent deformation may occur without earthquakes. This project will use a combination of ground deformation data from GNSS/GPS data, Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), and permanent seismometers to measure and investigate the kinematics of early-stage rifting across the Western and Southwestern rifts. Results will improve our understanding of fundamental tectonic processes and earthquake hazard estimates in the region. The project will provide student research opportunities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, develop international research collaborations, and contribute to capacity building in science and technology through outreach in secondary schools in the USA and Africa and providing opportunities in training in data processing and analysis through in-country workshops and visits to US research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to test existing models of how rifting is distributed across uplifted and faulted areas of Central Africa surrounding the Western and Southwestern segments of the East African Rift and determine what component of the active rifting is aseismic. To achieve this goal, geodetic measurements, including campaign and continuous GNSS and InSAR, in this under-studied area will be increased. This will provide improved constraints on the tectonic strain field across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Catalogue and regional seismic source data will be combined and then Kostrov summation comparisons of seismic and geodetic observations across the region will be performed in order to evaluate the amount and spatial variation in aseismic deformation and to constrain lithospheric properties.

At the beginning of the 1800s, prairie covered a great swath of North America. Since then, about 99% of the tallgrass prairie has been destroyed. The small, isolated patches of prairie that remain harbor great biodiversity, yet rates of local plant extinctions are alarmingly high in these remnant prairies. This project is advancing scientific understanding of why some populations go extinct and others persist. This project builds on a long-term investigation of these ecological and genetic processes and feedbacks between them affecting a model prairie plant species. The purple coneflower typifies prairie plants in its long lifespan, often decades, and in other attributes. This study is the first of its kind to measure the capacity of a population to adapt.

Researchers will use aster statistical models to estimate the amount of genetic variation in Darwinian fitness of individuals planted in 2003, many of which flowered for the first time in 2015. Other experiments will estimate the reduction in mean fitness due to mating between siblings. Together with demographic censuses of remnant populations, started in 1996, these studies will yield comprehensive assessments of population growth rates and the potential for evolutionary rescue.

Permafrost is ground that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years. It occurs under approximately one fourth of the northern hemisphere's land surface and contain as much carbon as the entire atmosphere.  Permafrost thaw leads to changes in the dominant vegetation and makes the carbon stored in the permafrost soil vulnerable to decomposition, but existing measurements and models disagree about the implications of these changes for the global carbon cycle.  This research project investigates how processes mediated by microbes, minerals, and their interactions with vegetation affect the vulnerability of carbon in permafrost soils.  The researchers are carrying out laboratory and growth chamber studies to investigate microbial communities and the transformations of carbon with permafrost thaw. They are incorporating the results of those studies into Earth system models to understand feedbacks to the climate system. This research is addressing critical knowledge gaps about how carbon stored in frozen permafrost will affect the Earth's carbon cycle, which is information urgently needed to inform climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is addressing the question: how will feedbacks between plants and soils (specifically minerals and microbes) affect arctic soil carbon balance in response to global change? Using state-of-the-science tools, such as microbial sequencing and stable isotope tracing, the researchers are carrying out (1) laboratory incubations to determine how soil microbial communities and mineralogy affect the fate of plant exudates and the vulnerability of native soil organic matter in thawed permafrost, and (2) plant-soil growth chamber mesocosms to trace belowground plant deposits into permafrost soils under ambient and elevated CO2.

However, the majority of this evidence stems from data on college-age research participants that are not representative of the broader population. Little is known about sleep and memory function in middle age. This research will examine how sleep contributes to selectivity effects in memory in middle-aged people. One example of memory selectivity is the tendency to remember emotional information extremely well, often at the expense of neutral information. This research builds on prior findings, of the role of sleep in selective consolidation of emotional memories in young adults. This project combines EEG, fMRI, and behavioral approaches to examine how different phases and features of sleep can re-wire neural circuits used to retrieve emotional memories; how such re-wiring may be influenced by the way an emotional event is first experienced; and whether such processes differ as a function of age. The research will provide educational and training opportunities at two universities, and will promote healthy aging through regional and national outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sleep promotes memory for emotional components of complex scenes while conferring no benefit to memory for neutral, contextual elements. Moreover, sleep preferentially consolidates information that attracts overt attention and provokes a physiological arousal response during encoding. During retrieval, these effects of sleep-based consolidation are reflected in enhanced activity and connectivity within limbic circuitry. This project investigates whether sleep continues to aide in the selective consolidation of emotional information in adults over the age of 35. If so, do correlations between emotion, brain connectivity, sleep, and memory stay stable with age? If age disrupts selective consolidation, what changes in sleep architecture and/or encoding-related processing are most predictive of that disruption, and at what age do those changes begin to occur? This project further characterizes downstream consequences of sleep-dependent memory consolidation by examining neural circuitry involved during retrieval, fMRI will reveal whether age influences the sleep-related enhancement in limbic activity and connectivity during memory retrieval.

The proposed innovation is for a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to learn how to autonomously determine and command maneuvers that yield a desired spacecraft formation. The proposed project could reduce customers\\u2019 cost of operations by removing humans from the closed loop control system. The proposed innovation scales to systems of large numbers of spacecraft without scaling the cost of flight operations. Other potential benefits to customers are risk reductions: a DRL agent does not require an exact model of spacecraft subsystems and orbital dynamics and can learn in real-time, thus being robust to off-nominal system performance and unexpected perturbations. Benefits of this project may include a DRL agent discovering novel guidance and control solutions for mission designs that are not known from legacy orbital dynamics approaches. Potential broader societal impacts include enabling Deep Space Gateway operations and science missions to sample in-situ, simultaneous measurements over a large area, resulting in valuable science data returns for research or commercial applications in Earth orbit or deep space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of implementing DRL as a solution for truly autonomous spacecraft guidance and control. The challenge motivating this project is the control of multi-spacecraft systems, where maneuver planning is neither intuitive nor straightforward due to the nonlinear equations of relative motion. Historically, solutions are found by making simplifying assumptions of circular orbits and linearized equations of relative motion. Such assumptions are avoided in this research plan. The primary research objective is to train a DRL agent using the high-fidelity model of NASA\\u2019s General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). First, the problem of achieving a particular formation or distribution will be formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Next, software infrastructure will be developed using TensorFlow, Python, and GMAT. Within this framework, the DRL agent will be trained to learn a policy that maneuvers the spacecraft into a specified formation, subject to operations constraints like available propellant and actuation limits. Anticipated technical results include comparisons of on-policy versus off-policy approaches to achieving coordinated spacecraft mission, demonstration of the technical feasibility of DRL-based flight software for guidance and control, and a characterization of the limitations of DRL-based control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.444890022277832, \"y\": 8.536409378051758}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"ADVANCE Adaptation: Gender Equity Advances Retention in STEM at Wayne State University (WSU GEARS)\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Wayne State University (WSU) is an urban campus in the heart of Detroit, Michigan. WSU GEARS ADVANCE project focuses on systemic institutional and cultural change to move WSU toward a place of belonging and valuing diversity where women STEM faculty thrive and succeed.

WSU began to address this gender imbalance through increased oversight of regular search procedures and by workshops that stressed the value of diversity and the risks of implicit bias. The result was a steady increase of women in WSU\\u2019s STEM faculty to 20% in 2018; notably less than 3% of these women were underrepresented minorities. While WSU has continued to increase these numbers and strengthen pathways for success of women and underrepresented minorities, addressing structural challenges at all institutional levels remains a priority. WSU GEARS will leverage successful intervention strategies developed by WSU and NSF ADVANCE peer institutions. This project will reshape the campus inclusion culture by capitalizing on existing momentum and collaborations, adapting relevant policies and practices at departmental, college, and university levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WSU GEARS ADVANCE Adaptation Project will reduce inequities for women and underrepresented minorities in STEM faculty through systemic change. Specifically, this project will tackle three barriers to the hiring, promotion, and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM on the WSU campus: (1) toxic work environments, (2) work/family/life strains, and (3) unequal workload burdens. To overcome these barriers, WSU GEARS will adapt proven programs developed under prior ADVANCE programs through the following integrated tracks: nuanced data collection to inform policies and practices (Wayne Drives), enhancement of existing WSU programs (Wayne Shifts), and creation of new WSU programs (Wayne Accelerates). The WSU GEARS Project will: 1) promote successful programs that improve campus climate and create greater equity among STEM faculty in hiring and retention; 2) identify additional barriers for women and underrepresented minorities in STEM, especially for intersecting identities, that need to be tackled beyond the current programs; and 3) provide nuanced data to guide institutional improvements for women and underrepresented minorities. WSU is committed to sustaining outcomes beyond the award term and will invest in institutionalizing successful programs to continue to enact positive systemic change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.

Unfortunately, little is understood of the fundamental chemical processes occurring at a sliding interface that lead to formation of friction and/or wear reducing films. The goal of this work is to exploit an array of surface analytical tools and novel theoretical approaches to obtain fundamental insights into the way that forces acting on the surface influence the chemistry to take the guesswork out of designing new lubricants for advanced materials.

The ideas behind the circular economy include keeping products in use, eliminating waste and pollution by design, and aiming to help nature.

Today, we clearly see that this linear model has led to serious unintended global consequences from resource depletion to global waste, spanning all industrial sectors, from plastics to the built environment.

The research focuses in particular on thermoelectric properties (the conversion of heat to electric power) and on the nature of the transition from conducting to non-conducting states.  Key questions include these: 1) which conditions and which materials are conducive to achieving an efficient conversion of heat to electric power?, and 2) what new forms of the metal-to-insulator transition are possible, and what are their experimental signatures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New topological thermoelectric materials may have applications in both waste-heat recovery and more efficient cooling.

Exploring these possibilities requires theories that go beyond the non-interacting, free-particle descriptions that led to the discovery and classification of topological materials.  The aim of this research is to produce such theories, focusing in particular on bulk thermoelectric transport and on the nature of the metal-insulator transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thrust of the research is concerned with the thermoelectric response of topological semimetals and its dependence on magnetic field.  The PI and his research team will consider magnetic Weyl semimetals, compensated topological semimetals, and other topological materials beyond Dirac/Weyl.  The goal of this work is to identify conditions and material properties that are conducive to achieving large thermopower and large thermoelectric efficiency.  A second thrust considers how topological systems admit novel bulk metal-insulator transitions, beyond the canonical Anderson and Mott perspectives.  The research team will consider different scenarios for such transitions, including in strongly disordered systems, hydrodynamic systems, and in electron systems with nonperturbative electron-phonon coupling.

This approach benefits from incremental assembly, which eliminates scale limitations and enables best-practice manufacturing for reliable, low-cost part production, and interchangeability through a consistent assembly process across part types. Further, the system can be automated. Precision and repeatability are embedded in the parts themselves. This project will match state-of-the-art performance metrics while reducing reliance on fixed tooling, offering customization for user-defined products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address issues of large-scale, digital manufacturing by introducing a new type of material based on modular, cellular units. In contrast to continuous, layer-based, additive deposition processes, this approach relies on discrete assembly. Here, global geometries are defined by local constraints, errors can be incrementally detected and corrected, heterogeneous parts can be joined, and parts can be repaired, reused, and recycled. The goals of this project are to define a material system (constituent material, unit cell geometry, and fastening solution) that can achieve high stiffness-to-weight ratios at low cost. Such properties do not currently exist in a single monolithic material; rather, they are achieved through expensive processes to shape traditional materials into complex geometries. These methods are labor-intensive and have significant capital expenditure for tooling. This project will demonstrate the ability of discrete lattice materials to match state-of-the-art while offering cost reductions through automation, reduction in factory overhead, and performance benefits unachievable with traditional methods.

However, this form of research also has practical value, as it could help us understand how species come to be pests, causing economic damage and sometimes spreading disease.  Our goal here is to ask if the secret to the success of one globally-distributed bird, the house sparrow, has to do with the way it uses its genome to combat parasites.  No place on Earth is safe from infection, so when animals colonize new places, they must kill or control new parasites, or the invasion fails.  Preliminary data show that house sparrows have an exceptional ability to adjust their immune systems via a process called DNA methylation.  We liken this ability to knobs on a radio; more knobs mean more sophisticated control of sound quality.  For house sparrows, more successful birds seem to have more knobs in their genomes, which we expect helps them adjust their immune gene expression and thus control especially new parasites well.  With this grant, we\\u2019ll perform experiments to test directly if more genome control knobs mean better protection from infections, then we\\u2019ll compare genome knob number between native and introduced groups of sparrows, expecting more knobs in invading birds.  We\\u2019ll also study sparrows in museum collections, asking how knob number has changed since introductions first happened in the 1850s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our plan is to leverage the near-ubiquity of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) to learn how the CpG (i.e., cytosines proximal to guanines in DNA sequences) content of gene regulatory regions influenced the distribution of this avian species. CpG content, something we term epigenetic potential (EP), might allow genotypes to mask and manifest phenotypic plasticity reversibly within generations, as some CpG sites alter gene expression when methylated. In support, preliminary data reveal that i) introduced sparrow populations have more CpG sites in two immune gene promoters than native populations, and ii) EP in promoters, but not exons, declined since introduction ~170 years ago in four independent populations. We expect that EP represents a form of adaptive potential, providing organisms with a propensity to cope with the novel conditions. In particular, we expect EP to be important to the regulation of Toll-like receptors, major microbial surveillance mechanisms that reside on and in leukocytes. In a series of experiments and descriptive field and museum studies, we will ask how are EP, DNA methylation, and TLR expression related within individual sparrows, whether EP for TLRs protective against gut microbial infections, if EP in TLRs influences gut microbial communities in ongoing range expansions, and finally whether EP for TLRs important to range expansions historically?

Few significant clinical or technological advancements have been made within the last two decades to improve organ matching success, and the accuracies of current models predicting survival outcomes are diminishing. There is a great need for clinicians to have better decision-making support tools. Every 12 minutes, a new person is added to the organ transplant waiting list, a number growing by about five percent each year. Within a single day, 21 people die waiting for a kidney, liver, or other organ match. Although 36,500 kidney and liver transplants are performed each year, the patient demand for donor organs far outweighs supply by four to one, so the need to improve donor-recipient matching is urgent. Optimizing the donor organ-patient match is a key determining factor for improving transplant success and patient survival. This project's artificial intelligence (AI) model will guide transplant surgeons, physicians, and other healthcare professionals will deliver precise, accurate, quantitative information for real-time predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes artificial intelligence to predict outcomes after solid organ transplantation procedures. Clinicians currently consider several factors when determining organ allocation and candidate patient ranking on the recipient waitlist, including extent of disease pathology, functional status of the recipient, and intrinsic donor and recipient compatibility factors. Measures, indices and functional status scores have been designed to predict specific outcomes but are not easily combined into one optimized decision to guide organ allocation decisions.

This project will train an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to comprehensively integrate all information available at the time of transplantation procedures (hundreds of variables) into a predictive model. An AI model of this nature would be a substantial improvement from linear models able to synthesize only a modest number of parameters (approximately 15) to date.

Some solid materials are crystalline; table salt and sugar are two familiar examples. In these cases the atoms or molecules that make up the solid are regularly positioned and highly organized, and their structure and properties do not change with time - they are at equilibrium.  In many other cases the solids are glassy, as if the particles in the liquid state were stuck in place. Window glass is just one example; it is made of small molecules containing silicon and oxygen.  A large fraction of specially designed materials, which often involve very large molecules known as polymers, are also in the glassy solid state.  Although glassy solids have been part of our surroundings for centuries, there are still aspects of their behavior that are not well understood. Examples from daily life include protective coatings, photoresists, polymers reinforced with nanoparticles, membranes, and filters. In each of these cases a significant fraction of the glassy solid molecules are near an interface; different kinds of experiments have led to the conclusion that these molecules can behave very differently from neighboring molecules ensconced in the bulk. A related problem is that, where glassy solid properties are carefully designed to optimize performance, as the material ages its properties can change in undesirable ways. These situations reflect the fact that glassy solids, unlike crystalline solids, are not at equilibrium; and their properties can shift over time.  These changes can affect their performance, and therefore cause problems. This project will produce new ways of modeling glassy solids that will account for the influence of a neighboring surface on how molecules pack.

The proposal also intends to bring this technology to a variety of learners (online and residentials, graduate, four- and two-year college, and self-learners). The project goals are to address (1) the paucity of scientific evidence regarding  novel learning environments enabled by immersive simulations in STEM education and (2) the lack of evidence regarding the contribution of virtual reality (versus use of simulations on a 2D display) to STEM education.

Although many AI tools are already available to law firms and legal departments, these tools do not typically reach members of the public and legal service practitioners except through expensive commercial paywalls. The research team will develop two tools to make legal sources more understandable: Statutory Term Interpretation Support (STATIS) and Case Argument Summarization (CASUM). STATIS is an AI-based legal information retrieval tool to help users understand and interpret statutory terms. It helps them find sentences explicating the terms of interest and cases applying these terms. Inputs to the system are queries about a statutory term and the provision from which it comes. The system outputs a list of sentences retrieved from case law that mention the term in a manner useful for understanding and elaborating its meaning. CASUM summarizes case decisions in terms of legal argument triples: the major issues a court addressed in the case, the court\\u2019s conclusion with respect to each issue, and the court\\u2019s reasons for reaching the conclusion. Given a case text, it outputs simple argument diagrams graphically summarizing arguments in the decision. Ultimately, the tools will be deployed through legal information institutes (LIIs) that provide free access to the public. They will help the lay public to understand, as well as to access, legal source materials by making it easy for them to find sentences in legal cases that provide definitions, tests, examples or counterexamples of statutory terms and to see the issues, conclusions, and reasons a court addresses in a decision.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project applies the latest natural language processing approaches. Pre-trained legal language models will improve the performance of machine learning in identifying sentences in legal cases that explain statutory terms or state issues, conclusions, and reasons. Recent developments in extractive and abstractive summarization, text simplification, and argument mining will generate high quality legal information for diverse users. A legal language model will be pretrained on a large corpus of publicly available court decisions and fine-tuned to identify features that play a significant role in retrieving high value sentences explaining statutory terms. A prototype module for retrieving and ranking such sentences by explanatory value and a graphical user interface ultimately deployable via an LII website will be developed. Using the legal language model, techniques for matching annotated sentences from case summaries to the corresponding sentences in the full texts will be developed and fine-tuned to classify sentences in which a court identifies issues, conclusions, and reasons justifying the conclusions.

Desalination of abundantly available seawater especially in coastal areas offers a viable option for conversion of seawater into fresh water. A number of schemes for desalination of water in the past have been developed. However, these schemes are either energy intensive or capital intensive. As a result, the cost of production of potable water is relatively high. The project will develop, analyze, and optimize a novel high-throughput desalination technique that is compact, modular, and relatively inexpensive to build and operate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this technique solar-heated sea water from a solar pond flows through a set of injector passages, where the water becomes superheated leading to formation of vapor bubbles. Formation of bubbles accelerates the pressure drop allowing more thermal energy to be converted into vapor. The vapor-liquid mixture exits the injector passages into a larger tube tangentially. Centrifugal force generated as a result of swirl causes liquid to move outward while vapor forms a core in the middle of the separator tube. Vapor leaves the vapor core via a retrieval tube to a condenser to create potable water. Separated liquid is pumped back to the solar pond to be reheated. Having demonstrated the viability of the concept in the laboratory, the team is proposing to expand the experimental work to demonstrate the applicability of the concept over a broad range of operational parameters. Data for thermal conversion efficiency, vapor separation effectiveness and temperature and pressure profiles in the injector passages and separator tube are to be obtained. The data will be used to support analytical and numerical modeling of the process. Void fraction in the separator tube is to be measured and stability of vapor core in the separator tube will be investigated under a variety of mass and momentum flux conditions.

A notable exception is that studies involving plastid genome engineering are carried out in tobacco, the only vascular plant species in which plastome engineering is routine. Recently, high-frequency plastid transformation in Arabidopsis was achieved by using plants hyper-sensitive to spectinomycin, the selective agent used in chloroplast transformation. The current bottleneck of plastid transformation in Arabidopsis is the difficulty of obtaining fertile plants from transplastomic tissue culture cells. Tissue culture limitations in Arabidopsis nuclear gene transformation were overcome by using Agrobacterium to directly transform the female gametocyte, and identification of nuclear transgenic events by germinating the resulting seedlings on a selective medium. Our goal is to re-engineer Agrobacterium for T-DNA delivery to chloroplasts to directly transform the plastids in the female gametocyte. Side-stepping the tissue culture process will eliminate the need for specialized expertise to practice plastid transformation in Arabidopsis. Therefore, research proposed here will lead to widespread applications of Arabidopsis plastid genome engineering which, combined with the available extensive genomic resources, will have a major impact on basic science and applications in biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agrobacterium T-DNA delivery has always been to the nucleus due to the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) on the VirD2 virulence protein. VirD2 is an endonuclease that excises the T-DNA at a 25-nucleotide sequence. During the T-DNA transfer, it is physically linked to the VirD2 protein and the complex is translocated to the plant cytoplasm via the Type IV secretion system (T4SS). A truncated VirD2, containing 204 amino acids of the N-terminus is sufficient for T-DNA delivery to the nucleus, as long as an alternative T4SS signal is provided at the C-terminus and alternative NLSs are provided at the N-terminus. The goal of the two-year EAGER proposal is to prove the feasibility of re-targeting VirD2 to chloroplasts. We will re-target a truncated VirD2 to chloroplasts by removing all NLSs and providing T4SS signals at the C-terminus and chloroplast targeting Transit-Peptide (TP) sequences at the N-terminus. The success of retargeting will be shown by excision of target sequences by a VirD2- recombinase fusion protein that creates a permanent footprint in chloroplasts. VirD2 delivery will also be shown in a split GFP assay, in which a short (13 amino acid) peptide fused with VirD2 will complement a truncated GFP protein that fluoresces upon delivery of the VirD2 fusion protein. Follow-up experiments will accomplish Agrobacterium-mediated chloroplast-transformation by construction of Agrobacterium strains lacking wild-type Vir proteins that could interfere with chloroplast targeting, and development of new vectors that will ensure T-DNA delivery to chloroplasts in the female gametophyte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.3147735595703125, \"y\": 5.76848030090332}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Hadron-hadron Scattering in Lattice QCD: Travel Supplement\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"For nearly four decades, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a leadership role in provisioning advanced cyberinfrastructure capabilities for the Nation's Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) researchers.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands with widespread disruption to economic and healthcare systems. Face masks have been shown to play a critical role in reducing coronavirus transmission. However, cloth masks do a poor job protecting the wearer from exposure and effective alternatives (i.e., N95 respirators) are in short supply for front-line workers and the public, creating an urgent need for a low-cost, safe, effective, and simple coating technology that reduces virus transmission. This project will develop a coating that can be applied directly to a face mask or mask insert.  Beyond COVID-19, future coating compositions could be tuned to address new viral outbreaks. Furthermore, respiratory protection via coatings or filter inserts are likely to be in high demand given the increased awareness from the current crisis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop molecular coatings with amphoteric properties to enhance virus adsorption from water-based aerosols. Ion exchange (IEX) materials are commonly used in aqueous environments as effective virus adsorbents because of pH tunable electrostatic affinity. However, these design principles have not been translated to a face mask coating because commercially available IEX materials: 1) utilize hazardous chemicals that require complex and centralized production, 2) lack tunability for adsorption in a fixed pH environment (i.e., human breath), and 3) typically absorb water which is detrimental to the respiratory protection of a mask. This project will overcome these limitations through the design of a heterogeneous surface coating.

Engaging this heterogeneous agent base in the context of the smart grid requires the use of hierarchical markets, wherein end-users participate in downstream markets collectively through aggregators, who in turn are coordinated by an upstream market.  The goal of this project is to conduct a systematic study of such market-mediated learning and control.   This project aims at much deeper levels of participation from end-users contributing electricity generation such as rooftop solar, shedding load via demand response, and providing storage capabilities such as electric vehicle batteries, to transform into reliable distributed energy resources (DER) at the level of wholesale markets.  A methodological theme is multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by agents that control physical systems via actions at different levels of the hierarchy.  Underlying the whole project are well-founded physical models of the transmission and distribution grids, which provide structure to the problem domain and concrete use cases.  This project facilitates a deeper level of decarbonization in the electricity sector, and contributes to climate change solutions by engineering a flat, interactive grid architecture that allows significant DERs to provide electricity services to both local and regional grids.  Engagement with a grid-level market operator enables the project to address a problem space of immediate relevance to the current electricity grid.  The project also includes the development of educational materials on data-analytics and energy systems.  Intrinsic to the program are efforts at outreach to involve high-school students via demonstrations and lectures based on the technology developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is a systematic and principled study of methods for hierarchical market-mediated learning and control, with the electric grid being the primary application domain.  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) runs as a common methodological theme through the project, with strategic agents with varying information structures and concepts of rationality that control physical systems via actions at different levels of the hierarchy.  The approach is different from studies on generic MARL algorithms in that attention is focused on well-founded physical models of the transmission and distribution grids, as well as the workings of the power system.  The project is organized into three interdependent thrusts, namely, (i) Learning to bid as aggregators in wholesale markets, which studies dynamics of aggregators that provide supply offers and demand bids at the upstream market (wholesale level), while procuring these services from downstream DERs (retail level), (ii) Learning to incentivize retail users to contribute their resources, under which bounded rational agents learn to respond to a population-level distribution of other agents and incentives provided, and (iii) Evaluation and experimentation over a full-scale system emulator by integrating it with reinforcement learning tools.  This project provides an architecture for DERs to provide electricity services to both local and regional grids, and hence contributes to developing solutions to climate change.  Engagement with an independent system operator enables a focus on grid-specific issues, ensuring the applicability of the solutions to real-world problems.

It focuses on effects of light on the synthesis of proteins required for photosynthesis, a process that consumes atmospheric CO2 and produces the carbohydrates that fuel life. Light drives photosynthesis, but it also damages the photosynthetic apparatus. Repair of the damage requires the replacement of damaged parts with newly synthesized proteins. This project examines how the same light that damages the photosynthetic apparatus also activates the synthesis of new proteins required for repair. An understanding of this repair mechanism has implications for crop productivity and resilience in the face of changing environmental conditions. High school students, high school teachers, and undergraduate students will gain hands-on experience with research through involvement in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary target of photodamage is a protein called D1, which resides in Photosystem II (PSII) and is encoded by the psbA gene. The rate of D1 synthesis increases with light intensity to provide D1 for PSII repair. In chloroplasts, this regulation occurs at the level of translation. Prior work revealed an intimate connection between light-induced D1 damage, the recruitment of ribosomes specifically to psbA mRNA, and a conserved protein complex in the thylakoid membrane that mediates PSII assembly and repair. This work culminated in a model that invokes the assembly/repair complex as the hub of a translational autoregulatory mechanism that couples psbA translation to the need for D1 following its light-induced damage. Experiments will test and elaborate on this proposed mechanism, with a focus on communication between the membrane-bound assembly complex and a translational activator in the stroma that binds psbA mRNA.

Yet, they continue to be plagued by persistent social and environmental responsibility violations, such as child and/or forced labor, hazardous working environments, excessive overtime, poor wages, and pollution. These violations not only pose societal burdens but can also create significant economic inefficiencies for firms in the forms of product recalls, fines, problem corrections, supply interruptions, stock value loss, and brand damage. To make a compelling business case for sustainable supply chains and eventually create them, firms must quantify the financial impacts of the responsibility violations of their suppliers, gain greater visibility into the responsibility-related risks of their suppliers for a more effective allocation of inspection resources, and implement appropriate decision support tools for managers to account for responsibility-related risks in sourcing decisions. The objective of this research is to couple data-analytics approaches with the newly available datasets on social and/or environmental violations of suppliers to generate the knowledge base needed for firms to move in this direction. This research develops descriptive and predictive statistical models, and behavioral decision support tools that can be deployed by firms to proactively manage responsibility in their supply chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research bridges an important methodology gap in supply chain management by utilizing data-driven approaches for managing supplier responsibility.

At many institutions, part-time faculty teach introductory STEM courses.  As a result, these faculty have an essential role in creating equitable opportunities for student success in STEM. However, institutional reliance on part-time faculty has been associated with lower first-year persistence and lower graduation rates.  Few research studies have examined what part-time faculty do in the classroom and how their actions relate to student learning. STEM education reform efforts often do not include part-time faculty, even though studies document the desire of part-time faculty to be included in institutional efforts, their interest in collaboration, and their need for greater awareness of campus resources and policies. This Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project intends to enhance the effectiveness of part-time faculty, leading to increased student success and persistence of students in first-year STEM courses taught by the participating faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a comprehensive faculty development program for part-time STEM faculty at Elmhurst University. Over the three-year duration of the project, 45 part-time STEM faculty members will participate in intensive faculty development.  The development programming will combine training in teaching methods with training about campus resources, including institutional support mechanisms as well as retention and inclusion initiatives. This comprehensive approach may serve as a model for other small, liberal arts institutions, that increasingly rely on part-time faculty. Through this sustained multi-year professional development effort, it is expected that part-time faculty will develop more student-centered conceptions of teaching, increase their use of evidence-based and inclusive teaching practices, and exhibit an increased sense of belonging with the institution. The project will expand institutional support for part-time STEM faculty by establishing a STEM department chair workshop focused on integrating part-time faculty into departmental conversations around teaching and learning, as well as supporting sustained professional development through participation in an online course in effective teaching. The improvements in instruction, combined with a greater ability to connect students with campus resources, are expected to enhance student success in first-year STEM courses.

Recent breakthroughs of this type have led to deeper understanding of fundamental problems in theoretical physics, probability theory, algebraic geometry and many other fields. Since the 19th century, mathematicians have applied this framework to better understand collections of two-dimensional arrays of data called matrix spaces.

The pieces of matrix spaces considered in this project, called matrix Schubert varieties, are comprised of matrices satisfying rank restrictions on specified submatrices. Matrix Schubert varieties are invariant under certain row/column operations -- this extends to a natural group action. By taking this group action into account, geometric and topological properties of matrix Schubert varieties solve central questions in enumerative algebraic geometry and intersection theory. Using a collection of tools from combinatorics and commutative algebra known collectively as 'Grobner geometry', this project will describe polynomial representatives that encode the geometric properties of matrix Schubert varieties.

In addition, they are power constrained, requiring minimal energy consumption during sensor data collection, processing, and transmission. Integrating low-cost and low-power components into a single size-limited device becomes a substantial challenge using conventional semiconductor fabrication materials and processes. This SBIR Phase II project will use a novel System-on-Foil approach that patterns efficient silicon circuitry directly into a novel flexible silicon substrate, alongside low-cost printed electronics.

This pick-and-place approach not only reduces device flexibility, but also leads to interconnection challenges that severely compromise device reliability.  This project leverages a thin film recrystallization process where equivalent silicon circuits can now be patterned directly into flexible silicon, resulting in a highly scalable manufacturing process that drastically improves device reliability.

Such building systems could enable immediate occupancy and minimum economic losses after an extreme event, contributing to continued national prosperity and welfare. Progress has been made towards addressing this challenge with the development of unbonded, post-tensioned, shear walls (UPSWs) in buildings; yet limiting issues for designing such shear walls remain. This research will explore an innovative concept for structural shear walls to resist lateral loads in buildings and perform damage free during an extreme event. The concept consists of coupled, unbonded, post-tensioned, reinforced concrete walls that interact with the foundation via a curved surface. Lateral deformations will be accommodated through a pendulum-type motion as the wall slides along the bottom curved surface. Lateral resistance will be provided by friction along the curved surface and the vertical unbonded post-tensioned cables. The post-tensioned cables also will help restore the wall to its initial configuration. Energy dissipation of these coupled pendulum walls will be provided by incorporating connecting devices that use elastic buckling and release accumulated elastic energy during the walls' deformations. The system response thus will leverage the resulting deformations rather than trying to constrain them, as in traditional systems. The result will be new technology related to the design of damage-free structural building systems, and a new way of thinking about leveraging system geometry and deformations for enhanced resilient and sustainable buildings. Parallel to the research effort will be complementary educational and outreach components, including the training of two Ph.D. students, research experiences for undergraduate students, a project website with tutorials and research findings for undergraduate and graduate students and practitioners, and outreach activities for middle and high school students.  The tutorials, as well as data from this project, also will be made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core idea of this research is that of a new design philosophy envisioned to be unrestricted by traditional material failure limit states. This philosophy will be verified through a new concept for coupled UPSWs. The material response limitations of rocking UPSWs will be addressed by harnessing the nonlinear kinematic behavior resulting from coupled system deformations. Thus, the project objective is to develop the enabling theory and technology for a new concept of UPSWs that can perform damage free and unrestricted by material failure limit states. This objective will be achieved through two unique and complementary features: (1) individual walls gliding along a circular path with no separation at the footing interface, and (2) continuous energy dissipation via devices with controllable elastic instabilities along vertical wall joints. This concept will be designated as a pendulum UPSW system, as it rotates about a fixed point on the wall. The approach to be followed will be to characterize the in-plane response of pendulum UPSWs as viable lateral load resisting elements, develop and characterize the use of elastic meta-materials and meta-structures for dissipating energy via elastic instabilities, and characterize the response of pendulum UPSWs coupled with elastic multi-stable structures as connectors. A combination of analytical, numerical (finite element), and experimental methods will be used. This research will lead to the fundamental integration of system geometry and deformations for the design of lateral load resisting structures that are resilient and sustainable. The study will promote new design concepts that harness deformations for optimal performance rather than performance objectives set to target material limit states.

The science investigation will be carried out as follows. Numerical ray tracing will be used to calculate the chorus wave power spectrum (frequency and wave normal angle) as a function of time and location along a given magnetic field line, including Landau damping. Then, the wave power distribution will be used to calculate the resultant pitch-angle change near the loss cone at each point along the field line due to resonant interactions with the obtained chorus wave field, including nonlinear effects. This is then repeated for a set of test-particles (i.e., energetic electrons) over a range of initial energies.

New theory is needed to establish the level of performance that can be achieved using automatic feedback and rescheduling as process measurements become available and when large process disturbances occur, such as equipment breakdowns and scheduled task delays. Computationally efficient algorithms are required to ensure the calculations can be carried out in real time; because these fast solutions may be suboptimal, a means of assuring the performance guarantees of the optimal, but slower solution, must be developed. Finally, because of the wide variety of scheduling problems that exist in the chemical processing industries, a corresponding range of optimization methods must be investigated to achieve required performance goals under process uncertainties and disturbances. While this research will target applications in both traditional and new classes of chemical production scheduling and material blending operations, the modeling, design, and solution methods developed in this research will be sufficiently general to be applied to scheduling problems arising in any manufacturing facility having production targets and constraints on materials, workflows, and inventories. A significant innovation of the proposed approach is to enable automatic rescheduling with minimal disruption on the arrival of new measurement information. This automated use of corrective feedback is absent in almost all manufacturing scheduling approaches in use today, and so this work will provide a transformative opportunity for improved business performance across many industrial sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intuitive notion of online, repeated optimization of a model-based forecast as a means of designing an automatic feedback control system has now taken hold in most advanced control technologies applied in the chemical process industries as well as many other industrial sectors such as robotic motion control, flight and land vehicle guidance control, etc. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to advance the state of the art in designing such systems and linking the design parameters to the performance and robustness properties of the closed-loop operating systems. The target applications in this proposal are characterized by discrete decisions (scheduling) and nonlinear models (blending). Designing the objective function and constraints, and demonstrating the performance under significant model uncertainty for this challenging class of applications will enhance both the underlying fundamental control theory as well as the application of these technologies to complex industrial manufacturing facilities. In batch scheduling, the assumption that all events (both decisions and disturbances) take place at an integer multiple of the sample time is often inaccurate. Therefore, a state estimation method tailored to batch scheduling that can automatically infer the state of the process from the available measurements, regardless of when an event occurs, will be developed. Finally, in the area of raw material and product blending, we face the problem of mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models that must be solved repeatedly in real time.

They are recruiting Alaskan undergraduates to participate in the research, contributing to ANSEP\\u2019s online resources that promote interaction between scientists and middle and high school students, and participating in ANSEP\\u2019s annual residential Career Exploration in Marine Science programs to engage middle school students in learning about deep-sea ecosystems and the variety of career pathways available in marine related fields. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Microbial production and consumption of methane is dynamic and widespread along continental margins, and some animals within deep-sea methane seeps rely on the oxidation and sequestration of methane for nutrition. At the same time, understanding of methane-dependent processes and symbioses in the deep-sea environment is still rudimentary. The goals of this study are to 1) examine the diversity of animals involved in methane-based symbioses and heterotrophic consumption of methane-oxidizing microbes and how these symbioses extend the periphery of seeps, contributing to non-seep, continental slope food webs; and 2) determine whether carbonates on the seep periphery sustain active methanotrophic microbial assemblages, providing a localized food source or chemical fuel for thiotrophic symbioses, via anaerobic oxidation of methane, or free-living, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria consumed by animals. The investigators are addressing these goals by surveying, sampling, and characterizing microbes, water, sediments, carbonates and animals at a deep seep site on the Aleutian Margin and a shallow site off Southern California. Shipboard experiments and laboratory analyses are using molecular, isotopic, geochemical, and radiotracer tools to understand transfer of methane-sourced carbon from aerobic methanotrophs under multiple oxygen levels, pressures, and photosynthetic food inputs. This approach offers a wide lens by which to examine the methane seep footprint, allow reinterpretation of past observations, and identify new scientific areas for future study. Improved characterization of the deep continental margin methanosphere informs climate science, biodiversity conservation, and resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.613802909851074, \"y\": 5.559420108795166}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CQIS: RUI: Quantum State Symmetry and Applications\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Recent cutting-edge and near-future quantum devices will push the boundaries of information processing in communication, computation, and measurement in ways that will probe new physical realms and enhance the foundational understanding of physics.

As a premier citizen science computer game, Foldit has already been played by over 600,000 people since its inception. This project aims to improve the capabilities of Foldit to enable scientists and citizen scientists alike to accurately build biological structures of varying types and sizes. This capability could strongly improve science\\u2019s ability to understand the basis of many biological phenomena. In addition to these scientific benefits, this project benefits both science education and society as a whole. This new capability will enhance the variety and quality of educational options using Foldit, improving it as a major interface between the scientific community and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an ongoing need for improvements for methods to solve crystal and cryo-EM structures. Foldit is a citizen science project in which users aid in many biochemistry problems, including model building and real space refinement in protein structure solving projects. Early tests suggest that these ventures produce high quality crystal and cryo-EM structures, but many improvements are needed to make Foldit a go-to option for structure solving problems. Recently, new versions of Foldit have been introduced that can be used by single scientists or lab groups, in addition to standard citizen science Foldit puzzles. These options will be leveraged to create a multi-scale modeling toolbox for structural biology problems. The additions proposed in this grant include integrating new crystallography refinement capabilities within Foldit, and adding new modes that allow much larger proteins to be handled in Foldit for cryo-EM. Together, these improvements will make Foldit a state-of-the-art structure solving suite for crystallography and cryo-EM.

The project will assess utility of law suspension as a way to limit the negative impact of a public emergency, specifically in reducing COVID-19 transmission. It will be one of the first to examine widespread law suspensions across countries where the suspensions are used to address the same public emergency (i.e., COVID-19). The project will identify whether legal suspensions matter to COVID-19 transmission, while identifying which laws, when suspended, have little impact. Factors that shape effective reduction of COVID-19 will be identified, as well as impacts on transmission when law suspensions cease. This project will provide critical guidance for decision makers who must balance public health against other considerations. Proper crisis response should advance health and welfare, promote scientific programs, and contribute to national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to assess the utility of suspensions of law (derogation) for preventing or reducing COVID-19 transmission. The project will model and assess socio-legal responses to COVID-19\\u2014specifically, emergency measures that suspend laws. Three qualities of derogation will be assessed: what laws are suspended, the degree to which laws are suspended, and duration of derogation. Reinstatement of derogation will be assessed according to the same three qualities. This project will gather data, operationalize and calibrate the data, establish a dataset, conduct analyses, and disseminate results, the dataset, and GIS map. The data will be analyzed to compare whether combinations of conditions, such as moderate degrees of legal limitations combined with strong health infrastructures, reduce degrees of virus transmission and promote prevention. This project will examine whether derogation is applied to specific social groups and what features shape use of derogation. The project will identify tipping points when transmission increases or decreases and the combinations of derogation and socio-legal factors for which transmission increases or decreases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.2423243522644043, \"y\": 6.698486804962158}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Experimental and Computational Study of Structure and Thermodynamics of Rare Earth Oxides above 2000 C\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Materials that can withstand ultrahigh temperatures are important to ceramic processing, aerospace, and nuclear applications. Oxides containing rare earth elements have high melting points, do not evaporate easily, and are generally chemically unreactive. This refractory nature favors high temperature applications, but at the same time makes the determination of their heat and energy relationships (thermodynamic) properties challenging, and current data are incomplete. Such data are essential for prediction of material stability or degradation during use in both simple and complex systems in a variety of extreme environments (such as high-temperature or high-pressure environments). New experimental and computational approaches to determine thermodynamics above 2000 degrees C form the primary focus of the project, which represents collaboration between Navrotsky's group at University of California at Davis performing thermochemical measurements and structural studies, and van de Walle's group at Brown University undertaking calculations and phase diagram assessments. The project provides university-level students an opportunity to participate in state-of-the-art experimental and computational research applied to high temperature processes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The goals are to develop, test and apply new methodology (i) to determine temperatures and heats of phase transitions (both solid-solid and melting) of rare earth oxides and oxycarbides above 2000 degrees C, (ii) to measure structural parameters, including thermal expansion and volume change upon phase transition by synchrotron X-ray diffraction on levitated samples above 1500 degrees C, (iii) to calculate high-temperature thermodynamic properties using ab initio density functional theory (with hybrid functionals) and molecular dynamics in conjunction with statistical mechanical techniques, and (iv) to generate a unified picture, based on both theory and experiment, of thermodynamic properties, to be made publicly available for use in calculation of phase diagrams (CalPhaD) modeling and other applications.  The combination of calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and computation provides both needed thermodynamic data and physical insight into the properties of refractory rare earth oxides, with extensions into more complex systems.

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available.

It is expected that he experimentally-validated modeling framework will introduce a new capability to advance the mechanistic understanding of deformation and failure of additively manufactured alloys in corrosive environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.795787811279297, \"y\": 7.847871780395508}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control of the MOLLER Experiment\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"A central goal of nuclear and particle physics is to obtain a complete understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces through which they interact.  The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years.  However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter.  To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The electron\\u2019s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM.  Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding.  The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron\\u2019s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model.  The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered M\\u00f8ller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals.  The collaborative project described in this proposal will develop subsystem #3; namely the design, construction, and testing of the MOLLER Normalization and Systematic Control apparatus.

As the transition to electric vehicles takes hold, potential markets for ultra-fast battery chargers for these electric vehicles will be sizeable.  Estimates for the commercial market for electric vehicle charging stations is projected to reach $27.7 billion by 2027 from an estimated $2.5 billion in 2019.

The project will focus on development of safe power conversion and transmission equipment that will be applied to power-matched fast-charge batteries currently emerging in commercial markets.  Because the power levels required for ultra-fast EV charging are necessarily high, the project will focus on innovative measures to ensure public safety and system reliability while obtaining high electrical efficiencies.

This project will provide constraints on the hiatus between eruptions. The hiatus will be estimated by a combination of cosmogenic exposure dating by applying 3He measurements and paleomagnetic secular variation. A better understanding of the eruption rates of Deccan Traps lavas will impact multiple disciplines, including volcanology, paleoclimatology, and paleontology.

The results of this analysis will then be tested statistically to determine whether the ways instructors communicate relates to student outcomes in the two course types.

This mixed methods project will explore instructor talk as a potential mechanism through which CUREs exert their influence. The project will specifically investigate whether and to what extent CURE instructors ask students more substantive questions, provide more mentoring support to students, and use more non-content talk than traditional lab course instructors. The project will also investigate the extent to which these forms of instructor talk relate to several psychosocial and motivational factors that predict students\\u2019 continuation and success in science. The research analysis will be accomplished by collecting audio recordings of instructors as they teach CUREs or traditional lab courses; conducting content analysis of the recordings using a deductive approach informed by research on instructor talk, classroom discourse, and research mentoring as well as an inductive approach to identify novel types of instructor talk; collecting pre/post data from students enrolled in the recorded courses on their science self-efficacy, scientific identity, and perceptions of the values and costs of continuing in science; and conducting quantitative analysis using mixed effects regression models to explore which, if any, forms of instructor talk are related to student outcomes.

For example, operating systems are designed to effectively utilize a computer's memory and processing units, and network protocols are designed to effectively utilize a networks' bandwidth. More broadly, a large fraction of the long literature on algorithm design and optimization is motivated by resource-allocation problems that arise in a wide variety of domains, ranging from project management and business administration to government policy and market design. Achieving effective resource-allocation outcomes is particularly challenging in multiagent systems, where a set of self-interested agents compete for shared resources. For example, in large computer networks there are multiple users that compete for the network's shared computational resources, such as its bandwidth, or access to its servers. Each agent's goal is to maximize its own utility, and the goal of the designer is to achieve system-level efficiency despite the agents' competing preferences. Without carefully designed resource-allocation mechanisms, the available resources would be underutilized, and massive amounts of social utility would be wasted; thus, it is imperative that these mechanisms are designed to the highest standard. The focus of this project is on the design of multiagent resource-allocation mechanisms that take into consideration the preferences of the participating agents and seek to maximize fairness and efficiency in the resulting outcomes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To address the competing incentives of the participating agents, the field of mechanism design in economics has provided very useful tools. By far the most effective among them is the use of monetary payments: charging for the use of the resources can ensure that only the agents who need them the most would be interested in paying the price. However, the use of monetary payments is often undesired or even infeasible, e.g., due ethical, legal, or practical considerations, so the mechanism needs to eschew monetary transfers. However, the vast majority of the literature on mechanism design has focused on the use of monetary payments, so money-free mechanisms are not well-understood. This project considers canonical domains of mechanism design without money from the perspective of the designer, with the goal of developing a coherent theory regarding what can and cannot be achieved in the absence of money. As a substitute for monetary payments, money-free mechanisms can instead penalize the agents by intentionally keeping some of the resources unallocated (a tool known as \\\"money-burning\\\"). This way, the improved incentives come at a cost in social utility, introducing novel trade-offs for the designer who needs to strike a balance between incentives and effectiveness.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. A primary aim is to explore the rapid evolution of reproductive systems using the extraordinarily diverse male gametes (spermatozoa) and female reproductive tracts (FRTs) of beetles. The researchers will gather gamete-FRT structural, behavioral, and multi-omic data from ground beetles (family Carabidae), whirligig beetles (family Gyrinidae), and related beetles in the suborder Adephaga (~40,000 species) to expand our understanding of gamete-FRT co-diversification and its role in the genesis of new species. Male gametes are typically thought of as functioning as a single individual cell, but many ground and whirligig beetles make groups of them (often called \\u201cconjugates\\u201d) by joining them together with a protein-rich rod that shows obvious differences between closely related species. These conjugates travel cooperatively within the FRT, but individual male gametes must dissociate prior to fertilization. The researchers will leverage and further develop the adephagan beetle system to advance the field of evolutionary biology and male-female interactions by further promoting the career of a postdoctoral researcher in the sciences as well as by including middle school and undergraduate students from groups that are also historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines in various phases of the project, from the collection of specimens via guided hikes to laboratory exercises working with beetles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will sample densely in Carabidae and Gyrinidae, gathering multivariate gamete and FRT morphological data for ~300 species, together with in vivo studies, which will be analyzed in a phylogenetic framework to resolve the biology of male gamete-FRT interactions and patterns of gamete-FRT co-diversification and rate co-variation across these lineages.

This need is forcefully advanced by policy leaders including the National Research Council and the College Board. They point out that learning is more effective when students organize and link information within a consistent knowledge framework, which is what big ideas should provide. Unfortunately, finding ways to teach big ideas effectively\\u2014so they become useful as knowledge frameworks\\u2014 is a significant challenge. Deep structure modeling (DSM), the innovation advanced in this project, is designed to meet this challenge in the context of high school biology. In DSM, students learn a big idea as the underlying, or \\u201cdeep\\u201d structure of a set of examples that contain the structure, but with varying outward details. As learners begin to apprehend the deep structure (i.e., the big idea) within the examples, they use the tools and procedures of scientific modeling to express and develop it. According to theories of learning that undergird DSM, the result of this process should be a big idea that is flexible, meaningful, and easy to express, thus providing an ideal framework for making sense of new information learners encounter (i.e., learning with the big idea). To the extent that this explanation is born out in rigorous research tests and within authentic curriculum materials, it contributes important knowledge about how teaching and learning can be organized around big ideas, and not only for deep structural modeling but for other instructional approaches as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has twin research and prototype development components. Both are taking place in the context of high school biology, in nine classrooms across three districts, supporting up to 610 students. The work focuses on three design features of DSM: (1) embedding model source materials with intuitive, mechanistic ideas; (2) supporting learners to abstract those ideas as a deep structure shared by a set of sources; and (3) representing this deep structure efficiently within the model. In combination, these features support students to understand an abstract, intuitively rich, and efficient knowledge structure that they subsequently use as a framework to interpret, organize, and link disciplinary content. A series of five research studies build on one another to develop knowledge about whether and how the design features bring about these anticipated effects. Earlier studies in the sequence are small-scale classroom experiments randomly assigning students to either deep structural modeling or to parallel, non modeling controls. Measures discriminate for the anticipated effects during learning and on posttests. Later studies use qualitative methods to carefully trace the anticipated effects over time and across topics. As a group, these studies are contributing generalized knowledge of how learners can effectively abstract and represent big ideas and how these ideas can be leveraged as frameworks for learning content with understanding. Two research-tested biology curriculum prototypes are being developed as the studies evolve: a quarter-year DSM biology curriculum centered on energy; and an eighth-year DSM unit centered on natural selection.

Yet, social distancing goes against the natural desire for social interactions.

This is especially likely for people who do not have access to highly immersive forms of virtual socialization, such as internet-based video calls that let people see friends and family. It may also apply more often for older adults (who are most vulnerable to COVID-19) because of less familiarity with technology-based interaction platforms.

One aim is to inform the development of interventions designed to avoid loneliness while engaging in social distancing.  Study 1 collects data from the same participants across multiple days. Measures of loneliness, concerns with contracting an illness, and amounts and types of social interactions will be collected. The research tests the hypothesis that participants with limited access to virtual social interactions (e.g., those with limited financial means, the elderly) will feel most lonely and report decreased concerns about disease, which will be associated with more frequent violations of social distancing behaviors.

Concrete fracture is a serious safety concern generally, and particularly during earthquakes. Fracture is always accompanied by cracking which, in the long term, leads to environmental degradation as well. Realistic fracture predictions based on standardized laboratory tests and computer simulations is therefore critical to strong and durable civil infrastructure. Recent research reveals that crack tips in quasibrittle materials are surrounded by a wide zone of visually undetectable microcracking damage, which controls crack growth yet is very sensitive to stresses that are parallel to the cracks. The effects of these crack-parallel stresses are currently unknown. This research will devise a new type of laboratory test, which can measure the changes of energy required for fracture growth at various crack-parallel stress levels. Testing will be conducted to better understand the effect of crack-parallel stresses on normal and high-strength concretes as well as fiber-reinforced concretes, and the results will be used to formulate a new mathematical model for quasibrittle fracture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crack-parallel stress effects have gone unnoticed because they do not appear in the currently standardized fracture tests and are not thermodynamic variables in existing linear elastic fracture mechanics and cohesive crack models. The key idea of this research is a modification of the notched three-point bend test with four crucial features: 1) plastic support pads at notch mouth introduce constant notch-parallel compression; 2) the end supports installed with gaps engage only when the pads are yielding; 3) the test setup switches from one statically determinate configuration to another, allowing unambiguous interpretation; and 4) the size effect method, most effective for fracture energy testing, is made possible. A finite element crack band model with a tensorial damage softening law will be developed and calibrated by optimal fitting of the test results. Finally, a multiscale model that incorporates mesoscale mechanisms of frictional slip, microcrack opening, interlock and splitting causing the crack-parallel stress effects will be devised. The results are expected to transform fracture mechanics of quasibrittle materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.665997505187988, \"y\": 7.80227518081665}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"STTR Phase I:  Individualized circadian rhythm therapy via schedule-sensitive photic interventions in shared workspaces\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support individuals with sleep disorders.

Students with mathematics difficulties (those performing below the 25th percentile) struggle to articulate their understanding of mathematical principles as they explain their solution approaches. Learning and understanding fractions in upper elementary school is especially challenging for students and often impedes learning for students as they advance in middle and high school mathematics. The purpose of the project is to improve mathematical explanations for students who struggle in mathematics, specifically with fractions. To accomplish this, the project will investigate the benefits of worked examples (i.e., already worked-out problems) as a mechanism to improve explanations for students who struggle. The project will develop worked example materials focused on fractions concepts for use with students with mathematics difficulties in Grade 5 and examine whether this approach to instruction enhances students\\u2019 mathematical explanations during intervention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project consists of three phases: development work, two short-duration randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a feasibility pilot study followed by a multi-site RCT. First, the team will develop various types of worked examples (correct vs. incorrect solutions; one vs. two solutions) that address critical fractions concepts and operations in Grade 5 standards. Researchers will then conduct two short-duration RCTs to determine which worked example types are most promising for developing explanations for students with mathematics difficulties. Finally, worked example materials will be further developed and embedded as an instructional component into a previously validated fractions intervention. Intervention lessons will be examined in a feasibility pilot, which will be followed by a multi-site RCT. Eighty eligible students will be randomly assigned to receive small-group fractions intervention with worked examples or business-as-usual control.

One testbed will be the 2018 eruption of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, which injured 23 people and destroyed more than 700 dwellings.

To meet expected food demand in 2050, when the world is projected to have an additional 2 billion people, it is imperative that we reduce crop losses to PPNs.  The goal of this project is to develop genetic-based resistance to PPNs using soybean and the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) as model pathosystem.  Plants have the ability to detect disease-causing organisms (pathogens) and then activate a robust defense response that ultimately leads to localized cell death to stop the invader. To detect pathogens, plants use sensor proteins that are modified by enzymes that pathogens secrete during the infection process. This project focuses on identifying enzymes secreted by SCN that are required for infection of soybean. Once such enzymes are identified, sensor proteins will be designed that can activate defense responses in soybean upon modification by these SCN enzymes.  Such a system would thus confer resistance to infection by PPNs without the use of costly and environmentally damaging pesticides and should be transferrable to a wide array of important crop plants that are damaged by PPNs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many plant pathogens depend on proteases to infect host plants. The Innes laboratory has developed a novel method for engineering resistance to such pathogens based on detecting these specific proteases. In Arabidopsis, cleavage of the host kinase PBS1 by the pathogen protease AvrPphB activates a strong defense response. The AvrPphB recognition sequence within PBS1 (seven amino acids) can be replaced by the recognition sequence for other pathogen proteases. These \\u2018decoy\\u2019 kinases can then be cleaved by the matching protease, which activates resistance.  Thus, by manipulating the PBS1 amino acid sequence, it is possible to engineer recognition of many pathogen proteases. This proposal seeks to extend this discovery to the crop plant soybean by engineering resistance to its single most important pathogen in North America, soybean cyst nematode (SCN). Prior work has shown that modification of soybean PBS1 so that it is cleaved by the NIa protease of soybean mosaic virus (SMV) confers complete immunity to infection by SMV. To assess whether proteases secreted by SCN contribute to virulence, the expression of candidate protease genes will be reduced using RNA interference and then the impact on soybean root infection will be assessed. Proteases that contribute to infection will then be further analyzed by identifying their targets in soybean root cells using biotin proximity labeling, and their cleavage sites identified using mass-spectrometry. SCN protease cleavage sites will then be inserted into soybean PBS1 genes using CRISPR-Prime genome editing, thus generating soybean lines that are resistant to SCN infection and free of transgenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.328010082244873, \"y\": 5.710030555725098}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Biophysical multiscale modeling of mitochondrial swelling\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Mitochondria are the \\u201cpower plants\\u201d of cells, providing ATP for myriad processes.

The primary mechanism of excessive mitochondrial swelling includes the opening of channels known as permeability transition pores. The mechanisms underlying the transition from the reversible to irreversible swelling remain unclear. What intra- and extramitochondrial factors are involved in swelling? How the physical and chemical characteristics of the IMM coordinate this process?

The values of modeling parameters will be calculated using parameter estimation techniques, and the model will be verified and validated by fitting analysis of the minimum average differences between the model and the experimental data.

The following science questions will be addressed through the use of reanalysis data, historical records of severe storm activity, and compositing techniques:   1) What are the physical pathways by which the intraseasonal frequency of severe convective storms is modulated by the MJO and GWO, what fraction of intraseasonal severe storm variability is explained by the MJO and GWO, and at what time lags does the modulation pathway tend to be strongest and weakest?  2) What observational evidence, taken from Rossby wave packet tracing and composites of synoptic- and mesoscale variables known to be associated with severe weather in the U.S. physically supports intraseasonal severe weather variability?  3) How does the modulation of severe weather events and favorable environmental conditions vary by geographic region, by time of year, by diurnal cycle, and by phase of ENSO and how does the time lag identified in question 1 vary with any of the above factors?  4) How common are intraseasonal Forecasts of Opportunity, null events, and extended periods with little-to-no severe convective storm activity and on what do they depend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.7533464431762695, \"y\": 7.008179187774658}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research:  WoU-MMA: Askaryan Radio Array:  The World's Forefront Neutrino Astrophysics Program from 100 PeV\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This award will push the frontier of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino astrophysics above 100 peta-electron-volts (PeV) with the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) testbed at the South Pole Station, whose dataset is now large enough to enable either a discovery of the highest energy neutrinos ever detected or setting the world\\u2019s best constraints in this crucial energy regime.

They confront even more complex choices when conversing with other bilinguals. While bilinguals may choose to stay in one language, they may also code-switch between languages within a conversation. This immense variability in bilingual language use potentially relies upon general cognitive control mechanisms which over time may result in more efficient processing, a hypothesis known as the bilingual advantage. Prior research has had mixed results in confirming or disconfirming this hypothesis, in part due to reliance upon between-groups experimental designs and correlational analyses. This project builds on prior work by examining what aspects of bilingual language use may engage cognitive control within the same bilingual individuals and across the comprehension and production modalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes an experimental paradigm known as conflict adaptation across four experiments. The experiments intersperse two different tasks, one linguistic and the other not, under the assumption that engaging with cognitive control to resolve conflict on one task will lead to more efficient use of cognitive control on a subsequent task (the conflict adaptation effect). The four experiments test whether different forms of code-switching that vary in their degree of complexity will lead to differences in behavioral (Experiments 1, 2, 4) and neural (Experiment 3) performance on a subsequent non-linguistic task. Experiment 4 further tests the relationship between production and comprehension.

Potential applications include their use as capsules for the delivery of drugs to target organs, where they can be selectively released.  To realize such applications, Professor Thoburn and his team of undergraduate students are studying the underlying chemical reactions of these molecular cubes.  They address questions such as how the molecular cubes close and open to catch and release their guest molecules, and how the guests can be used to probe the interior structure of the cube.

It excels in such tasks as predicting stock market behavior, disease progression, etc. It is ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood of different known causes to have been the contributing factor. For example, given the symptoms of a patient, it can compute the probabilities of various diseases that could be causing the symptoms. Unfortunately, implementing Bayesian networks usually requires complex hardware that is expensive, prone to failure, dissipates too much energy and consumes too much area on a computer chip. The goal of this research is to overcome these disadvantages by replacing traditional electronic hardware with magnetic devices that interact with each other in a special way to elicit Bayesian inference. This can reduce the hardware complexity and all associated costs dramatically, making Bayesian networks compact and efficient. This research will establish the viability of this approach through extensive simulations. Graduate students will be trained in this field to produce a pool of skilled scientists and engineers with cutting-edge knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian networks for computing in the presence of uncertainty leverage Bayesian inference engines implemented with complex hardware that often involves microcontrollers, shift registers, analog-to-digital converters, logic gates, etc. that dissipate exorbitant amounts of energy and have enormous footprints on a chip. It ha recently been shown by the project team that magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that interact with each other by means of dipole coupling can implement Bayesian networks with vastly reduced energy cost and much smaller footprints.  Two dipole coupled MTJs A and B can realize an extremely efficient 2-node Bayesian network, where the probabilities of high and low resistance states of MTJ A are set by current or voltage, while the (random) resistance state of MTJ B is determined by varying degrees of dipole coupling between the two MTJs. The degree of dipole coupling is tuned with local strain applied to the soft layer of MTJ B using electrical excitation. This allows one to generate any desired anti-correlation or correlation between the resistance states of the two MTJs that can be varied between 0% and 100% using electrical excitation. In turn, this allows the generation of programmable conditional probabilities that can be exploited for Bayesian networks. This research will build a simulation base for this approach, test the viability of MTJ-based inference engines under different scenarios and design optimal sub-systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.991669178009033, \"y\": 9.511801719665527}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: Kinetic Behavior of Post-Flameout Ignition Events\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Flameout is an adverse event in aircraft operation in which the flame in the combustor is extinguished during flight.

This project will help to fill a critical knowledge gap by investigating the fundamental chemistry of post-flameout reignition, which is necessary in designing effective engineering strategies to re-light stalled aircraft engines at altitude. The project will use computational chemistry methods and fundamental experiments to understand the chemical mechanism of post-flameout ignition and determine how pressure and temperature influence the behavior of ignition.

The project will address two central research questions: 1) How does the mechanism for ignition vary at extreme temperature and pressure conditions? and 2) What is the effect of boosting ignition with thermal radical precursors after flameout? Two different jet fuel surrogates (JP-10 and a POSF 4658 surrogate) will be studied using electronic structure theory approaches to determine the relevant reactions for ignition, calculate the rates by which those reactions occur, and develop combustion kinetic models to predict their chemical behavior under relevant temperature and pressure conditions. To confirm the accuracy of the theoretical work, the study will use complementary experimental studies to detect combustion intermediate via photoionization mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Further, it will conduct a kinetic study of the effect of radical precursors as ignition boosting additives to assess their viability as a chemical solution to post-flameout re-ignition.

This is partly because Ps is a composite object which makes both theory and experiment more difficult.  Recently, experiments have shown that electron and Ps scattering are surprisingly similar over a wide range of projectile velocities.  At very low Ps velocities there is some discrepancy between experiment and theory, and fundamental questions remain to be answered.  This work can help to understand the similarity at higher velocities and to resolve the discrepancy at low velocities.

However, they have been relatively underexplored by the natural language processing community due to major difficulties in modeling, evaluation, and data collection. The technologies developed in this project address these challenges by (1) developing platforms that leverage existing online author communities to enable the design and evaluation of machine-in-the-loop writing assistants; (2) advancing text generation modeling to improve the quality of generated text; and (3) enabling assistants to rewrite and reorganize human-authored text through developments in automatic paraphrasing. In addition to aiding authors in online communities, the writing assistants developed through the project are deployed in K-12 classrooms to advance writing pedagogy. The project incorporates undergraduate students, including those outside of computer science, in natural language processing research, and provides significant outreach to underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make meaningful progress on the development of machine-in-the-loop writing assistants, the project includes a collaboration with Protagonist Labs, which runs online platforms for collaborative storytelling in both creative and pedagogical settings and already has incorporated systems built by the investigator\\u2019s team into user-facing interfaces.

As a result, there are huge energy and monetary wastes in today's datacenters and it is hard to incorporate new hardware innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project intends to break the traditional server model into fine-grained hardware resources. Instead of packaging hardware devices in a server and connecting servers with a network, future datacenters  will connect hardware devices directly to the network.

Fluids are all around us, and we can witness the complexity and subtleness of their properties in everyday life, in ubiquitous technology, and in dramatic phenomena such as tornados or hurricanes. There has been an enormous wealth of knowledge accumulated in the broad area of fluid mechanics, yet it is quite remarkable that many of the most fundamental and relevant in applications questions remain poorly understood. Of particular interest is the question whether solutions to equations describing fluid motion can spontaneously form singularities. Understanding singularities is important because they often correspond to dramatic, highly intense fluid motion, can indicate the range of applicability of the model, and are very difficult to resolve computationally. Moreover, there are indications that mechanisms responsible for singularity and small-scale formation are also involved in production of turbulence. The project aims to analyze singularity and small scale formation process for some of the key equations of fluid mechanics. Some equations with related structure inspired by problems originating in biology will be considered as well. The award will provide opportunities and research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is concerned with analysis of several equations in fluid mechanics and related models motivated by biological phenomena. The main theme is the analysis of singularity and small scale formation in solutions. The surface quasi-geostrophic equation comes from atmospheric science, and models evolution of temperature near the Earth's surface. The incompressible porous media equation describes flow of fluid of variable density through porous media. One research direction will focus on better understanding of nonlinear mechanisms responsible for fast generation of small scales and potentially singularities in the solutions of these equations. Another direction aims to further analyze the Hou-Luo scenario for singularity formation in the three-dimensional Euler equation. The scenario was proposed several years ago based on extensive numerical simulations, and so far all simplified models and settings that have been analyzed rigorously suggest finite time blow up. Here the main goal will be to better understand the boundary layer where intense growth of vorticity is observed, and to design and explore models that are increasingly close to the actual equation. The research will also include analysis of equations modeling collective behavior and chemotaxis in biology.

However, for simplicity, the study of species interactions in ecology most often focuses on interactions between pairs of species. Ecologists often then assume that our understanding of interactions between species pairs can be used to make sense of the dynamics of entire communities. This core assumption is challenged by the potential for Higher Order Interactions (HOIs), which occur when the interaction between a pair of species is changed by the presence of a third species. HOIs can either make it easier or more difficult for species to coexist in a diverse community, depending on the strength and the nature of the effects. The possible existence of these interactions therefore fundamentally challenges our understanding of how biodiversity is maintained in natural communities. However, we know very little about how strong or widespread HOIs might be in nature.  The research will quantify the strength and prevalence of HOIs among plant species in a grassland community and test if certain physical or physiological characteristics of plant species make HOIs more likely to occur. The project will address a fundamental challenge in community ecology, train a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher, and be used to improve courses offered at the high school, undergraduate and graduate level.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will combine large-scale field experiments, detailed measurements of plant functional traits, and the application of mathematical theory to ask three questions: (1) How strong are Higher Order Interactions (HOIs) among competitors in nature? (2) How do HOIs affect opportunities for species coexistence? (3) Can ecologists predict the magnitude of these interactions in nature with knowledge of plant functional traits? The project will quantify the magnitude of nearly 150 three-way HOIs through a large field experiment in a California annual plant community subjecting focal species to simultaneously varying densities of two different competitor species. Models with HOIs will then be fit to the demographic data collected. To address the coexistence consequences of the fitted HOIs, the invasion condition for coexistence and species persistence times will be evaluated in parameterized models that either include or exclude these HOI terms. To assess the predictability of HOIs, the research will measure how plant functional traits plastically respond to the densities of other competitors, and this information will be used to predict the value of the fitted HOIs. Taken together, the research will allow ecologists to both quantify the importance of HOIs for species coexistence and identify their functional basis, laying the groundwork for further mechanistic studies of these interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.081848621368408, \"y\": 4.858561038970947}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CIF: Small: Learning and estimation with rough non-convex objectives: Fundamental limits and efficient algorithms\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"A large number of problems in signal processing, statistics and machine learning require minimizing a cost function with many unknown variables. In a general setting, this task is computationally hard, unless the cost function has the mathematical property called convexity, a case that has attracted a large amount of work over the last fifty years. On the other hand, modern applications often rely on the more complex non-convex formulations, which are optimized using simple algorithms that are not necessarily optimal.  This project explores the hypothesis that, for a broad class of non-convex cost functions, one can find optimal solutions in the typical instances of these functions, even if the worst case might be impossible to optimize. The outcomes will have impacts on all scientific fields and real-world problems that feature non-convex cost functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at studying probabilistic models of cost functions that are of `mean-field' type, namely they do not have a latent low-dimensional structure.

While many studies find that communities with higher biodiversity have lower disease risk, some studies show no effect of biodiversity on disease risk and others even find the opposite effect (i.e. communities with higher biodiversity have higher disease risk). Overall, the idea that biodiversity can reduce disease risk is attractive because it suggests that protecting biodiversity has clear benefits to both nature and society.

This research tests the hypothesis that intraspecific host variation, generated by divergent evolutionary histories, plays a cryptic role in shaping the direction and magnitude of the BDD relationship. To this end, the research focuses on amphibian host-parasite interactions and takes advantage of an experimentally tractable group of focal wood frog populations that exhibit intraspecific variation in parasite susceptibility as a result of evolving in contrasting environments. The researchers will first, evaluate the contribution of intraspecific variation to shaping the BDD relationship by generating mesocosm communities that vary in amphibian host species diversity and focal host intraspecific diversity. Second, to integrate ecological context into our understanding of how intraspecific variation influences the BDD relationship, the researchers will conduct lab and mesocosm studies testing whether intraspecific variation in focal hosts can shape the BDD relationship by modifying (a) competitive, (b) predator-prey, or (c) host microbiota interactions. Third, to complement the controlled experimental studies, the researchers will conduct a citizen-led field surveys to evaluate whether intraspecific variation modifies the BDD relationship in more complex natural ecosystems.

This research has the following objectives: 1) determine robust ages of moraines using terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclide (TCN) dating methods to provide information about both the timing and extent of multiple LLGM ice limits; 2) rigorously evaluate centennial-scale records of glacial flour flux using high-resolution geochemical archives from the recently acquired Lake Jun\\u00edn drill-core record; 3) test the scale and climatic forcing of LLGM climate variability using climate model simulations; 4) test the scale of LLGM glacier variability responses to climatic forcing using energy and mass-balance models. This research will produce multi-proxy, centennial-scale records of mountain glaciation in Peru spanning the LLGM, at a scale and resolution that has not yet been achieved. This resolution will be sufficient to make comparisons with ice cores from Greenland, Antarctica, and the tropical Andes, as well as decadal-scale speleothem-based stable isotope records of hydroclimate changes from the same (Lake Jun\\u00edn) catchment. This will allow for a collective evaluation of mountain glacier archives and other regional records of past atmospheric variability that will improve our understanding of the role of the tropics in abrupt global change events on millennial timescales. These records will provide insight on the sensitivity of tropical glaciers to a range of climate conditions, both atmospheric and oceanic, and particularly how the tropical climate system responds to meltwater forcing. Ultimately, these records will inform how the tropical hydrologic cycle drives glacial-interglacial cycles in both the low and high latitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.853133201599121, \"y\": 5.77372932434082}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"RAPID: Group Effects on Pile Downdrag Following Liquefaction\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Several of the earthquakes that occurred during the 1811-1812 New Madrid earthquake sequence were identified by the United States Geological Survey as being the largest earthquakes East of the Rocky Mountains and within the top 20 of the largest domestic earthquakes United States history.  The seismic waves from these earthquakes propagated for a great distance because of the competency of the surrounding bedrock, and because the earthquakes occurred in the middle of the continental plate.  Soil liquefaction, where soil below the water table temporarily becomes a viscous fluid following shaking, was observed to occur during the New Madrid earthquakes. Liquefaction results in a loss of strength in the soil that serves as the bearing material for most infrastructure. If the same size earthquake as the 1811-1812 sequence were to occur today, the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency warns that the earthquake could result in the highest economic losses due to a natural disaster in the United States.  Because the areas near the earthquake are now densely populated (St. Louis, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee) additional understanding of behavior of civil infrastructure when exposed earthquake induced liquefaction is needed to prevent loses.  To remedy this lack of understanding, small explosive charges will be used to produce liquefaction under full-scale conditions and measurements will be made of the foundation settlement and the downward friction force on the foundations. Tests will be performed on two pile groups a site in Arkansas. Primary support will be provided by Nucor Yamata Steel Corperation; however, supplemental funding from NSF will significantly expand the scope of the project. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will provide that supplemental funding. The results from these tests will allow engineers to evaluate the accuracy of existing design procedures and develop modifications to produce better agreement with measured behavior. Improved design procedures will allow engineers to design safer yet cost-effective foundation solutions that will remain stable during earthquakes. Limitations of the previous study at the Turrell Arkansas Test Site will be overcome by 1) testing groups of piles instead of individual piles, 2) leaving the deadload on the foundations for a longer period of time prior to blasting to allow the neutral plane to develop, and 3) leaving the deadload on the foundations for a longer period of time after blasting to allow the neutral plane to redevelop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve our understanding of liquefaction-induced downdrag/dragload on deep foundations, blast induced liquefaction tests will be performed on two different pile groups (steel pipe group, H-pile group) at a site in Arkansas. The objective is to measure negative skin friction and downdrag induced settlement. With the inclusion of a static load placed on top of the pile groups, the results from these tests will allow researchers to evaluate the accuracy of existing design recommendations and develop modifications to produce better agreement with measured response. Because deep foundations are a common approach for supporting structures in liquefiable sands, reliable design approaches are critical to provide cost-effective foundations that are safe in future earthquakes.  The results obtained from this project will be used to mitigate liquefaction induced damage at other earthquake prone sites with a similar geologic profile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 8.082940101623535, \"y\": 6.541537284851074}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"RAPID: A Platform for Mitigating the Impacts of COVID-19 on the Healthcare System\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This COVID-19 RAPID research program will focus on addressing the shortage of essential medical supplies, Personal Protective Equipment, and crucial medical technologies.

Determining the best available science requires synthesizing multiple scientific results to gauge both the level of scientific consensus and the reliability of the research. However, on some policy-relevant topics, different syntheses come to incompatible conclusions. Such inconsistency in the synthesis of evidence wastes money, generates misleading results, and can lead to poor decisions impacting large numbers of people. Through research, education, and outreach, this CAREER project aims to develop and test a novel framework of tools and workflows that will reveal potential sources of bias in expert literature. The framework will enable stakeholders to quickly understand which individuals, institutions and funders contributed to the creation of the evidence. It will assess other factors that create risk of bias as well as the degree of confidence an expert community has in the evidence presented. Research outcomes could facilitate data-driven decision-making in a broad range of areas. Examples include topics in energy and environmental sciences and health sciences, like the carbon footprint of various forms of food production, herd immunity, and vaccine effectiveness.

In a 2018 report, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that jobs in data science and analytics will grow 34% by 2026.  However, thus far, very few two-year institutions offer data analytics programs that could prepare students for entry-level positions in data science and analytics.  To create new pathways into data science and analytics careers, this project intends to establish a college credit-based certificate in data analytics.  In concert with this goal, it also aims to increase the College\\u2019s capacity for high quality data science instruction and to broaden participation in data science, with a focus on inclusion of women.  In addition to its potential to increase the capacity and quality of the data science workforce in New Jersey, the project may also provide a model for other institutions that are interested in building new data science programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of the project is to develop a 15-credit data science certificate that integrates technology such as R, Tableau, Python, and SQL into the curriculum.

Although continental stretching and breakup has occurred repeatedly over Earth\\u2019s history, the early stages in this process remain poorly understood. In addition to being an important scientific topic, continental stretching is also essential to understand for assessing geohazards; rift zones like the East Africa Rift System are seismically and volcanically active.  Over the past 10 years, a number of new scientific studies focused on the southern part of the East Africa Rift System have emerged that are providing new and surprising insights into the onset of continental breakup. This award will support a 4-day workshop in the summer of 2021 in Malawi, which is located within the rift valley, to bring together ~50 US and African scientists to share and synthesize the results of these recent studies to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of continental stretching and associated hazards in the southern part of the East Africa Rift system. This workshop will also provide opportunities to strengthen existing relationships and form new collaborations between US and African scientists, training for early career scientists, and public outreach on the rift and its hazards.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EARS exhibits along-strike changes in magmatism, deformation and cumulative stretching, offering the opportunity to examine active rifting processes at different stages of development and study controls on rifting. These attributes made the EARS an excellent locality to address major questions about rifting posed in the NSF GeoPRISMS science plan.  The southern section of the EARS constitutes an endmember of this system in two important respects: 1) there is limited volcanism at the surface, providing the opportunity to more fully test models that require magmatism to weaken and thin the lithosphere, and 2) relatively little cumulative stretching has occurred, making it possible to observe controls on rift initiation. In the last ~5 years, a number of US and international studies have yielded interesting and surprising results on the southern EAR. However, because many EARS-related efforts were funded late in the GeoPRISMS program due to the phased funding model and/or leveraged efforts funded by other programs, there has not been an opportunity for the interdisciplinary community to meet and discuss these results in the context of the GeoPRISMS efforts.  The 4-day workshop supported by this award will enable US and African scientists to meet in person and share results; in-person meetings are essential to foster communication and develop and maintain strong international collaborations.  The workshop will take place in the summer of 2021 in Malawi, which is located within the rift valley, central to the focus area of the workshop.

This project aims to exploit publicly available proteomic data for predicting tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of peptides.

Besides synthetic particles, many organisms also generate naturally occurring iron oxide nanoparticles, known as ferritin, to store and regulate iron within their bodies. Whether man-made or natural, these iron oxide nanoparticles have a magnetization that can be used as a tool for manipulation or sensing in biological environments. However, nanoparticles often aggregate in complex bio-environments, and the effect of aggregation on their collective magnetic properties is not well understood. The overall objective of this work is to explore the relationship between nanoparticle clustering and resultant magnetic properties. Findings from this work can be potentially used to engineer magnetism-based sensing tools for more accurately tracking iron nanoparticles in biological systems. Data from this project can also advance other biomedical applications of iron oxide particles, such as their uses in magnetic hyperthermia for cancer therapy or as contrast agents for medical imaging. Besides advancing the field of bio-magnetism and nano-biotechnology, this research project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing research experience to students in state-of-the-art techniques for synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles, by enhancing infrastructure for research and education through the development of new techniques for magnetic characterization and by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron-oxide nanoparticles have become crucial tools in biomedicine and bio-nanotechnology due to their magnetic behavior. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles (~5 to 10 nm in diameter), and naturally occurring ferrihydrite core (~ 5 to 8 nm) present in ferritin, the largest iron-storage protein in the human body. Determining the spatial localization and quantification of these iron-oxide nanoparticles in cells and tissues is critical for a number of applications in health. Thus far our ability to characterize the spatial distribution and quantity of iron oxide nanoparticles is limited to biochemical approaches like histochemical staining, which are largely qualitative. Magnetically sensitive detection offers an alternative, non-destructive, label free and quantitative means for characterization of iron-oxide nanoparticles. However, in biological systems, nanoparticles are often found in aggregates/clusters, which can impact their local and global magnetic properties and complicate interpretation of magnetic signals. The goal of this project is to understand how clustering of bio-inspired iron-oxide nanoparticles affect their magnetic properties across many length scales (nanometer to micrometer scale). Specifically, interactions between individual particles, as well as between larger clusters of particles, will be studied using a range of magnetically sensitive techniques. Biologically derived clusters of particles as well as artificially engineered aggregates will be used for the study. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles and naturally occurring ferrihydrite cores present in ferritin. In some cases, clusters will be nanofabricated using template guided assembly, so that geometric parameters of clusters such as size, shape, and interparticle distance can be varied systematically. Characterization of particle assemblies will be performed using techniques such as analytical electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, super-conducting quantum interference device magnetometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Results from this study will be used to develop advanced, magnetism-based metrology for localizing and quantifying aggregates of iron oxide nanoparticles in biological environments. An understanding of the effect of clustering on magnetic properties can enable quantitative histo-magnetic detection schemes for mapping iron deposits in tissue sections.

Within the drylands on Earth, the Antarctic deserts, represented in this study by the McMurdo Dry Valleys, exemplify life in extreme environments with scarce water, low temperatures and long periods of darkness during the polar winter. There is a scarcity of methods to determine water availability, data necessary to predict which species are successful in the drylands, unless measurements are done manually or with field instruments. This project aims to develop a new method of determining soil moisture and use the new data to identify locations suitable for life. Combining these habitats with known species distributions in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, results from this project will predict which species should be present, and also what is the expected species distribution in a changing environment. In this way the project takes advantage of a combination of methods, from recent remote sensing products, ecological models and 30 years of field collections to bring a prediction of how life might change in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in a warmer, and possibly, moister future climate.  This project benefits the National Science Foundation goals of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic biota and the processes that sustain life in extreme environments.

This project proposes to integrate remote sensing, hydrological models and ecological models to establish habitat suitability for species in the McMurdo Dry Valleys based on water availability. The approach is at a landscape level in order to establish present-day and future scenarios of species distribution. There are four main objectives: remote sensing development of moisture levels in soils, combining biological and soil data, building and calibrating models of habitat suitability by combining species distribution and environmental variability and applying statistical species distribution model. The field data to develop habitat suitability and calibration of models will leverage a the 30-year dataset collected by the McMurdo Long-Term Ecological Research program.

Within heterotic string theory, novel geometric tools will be used to compute previously undetermined aspects of the effective theory.  These include the N=1 matter field Kahler potential, physically normalized Yukawa couplings, and vacuum values of the perturbative superpotential.  The non-perturbative contributions to Yukawa couplings will also be computed via quantum sheaf cohomology, a generalization of ordinary quantum cohomology.  Within F-theory, new results in the geometry of elliptic fibrations will be used to study the properties of singular Calabi-Yau manifolds and their links to Hitchin systems, as well as to study the implications of the ubiquity of multiply fibered manifolds for string dualities, effective theories, and possible boundedness of the set of smooth Calabi-Yau varieties.  Recent progress in heterotic/F-theory duality will be used to extract new features of the effective theories describing F-theory compactifications, including the explicit four-dimensional field-dependent form of flux contributions to the superpotential.  Finally, Professors Anderson, Gray, and Sharpe will also apply some of their recent insights into the global structure of moduli spaces of SCFTs to study possible swampland conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.479147911071777, \"y\": 9.501943588256836}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: Tissue Microstructure Characterization through Exchange Mapping with Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"PI: Seiberlich, Nicole E.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1553441 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tissue microstructure properties have been shown to change in the presence of disease, but these properties are difficult to measure quickly and accurately in vivo. The goal of this project is to develop and test a new technique, known as MRF-X, to probe in vivo tissue microstructure by using standard Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners to collect data in a new way. After optimizing the MRF-X method, the properties of both skeletal muscle and brain tissue will be measured, and differences between healthy and abnormal tissue quantified. This technique will enable researchers to study how diseases progress as well as allow physicians to examine tissue microstructure to better diagnose disease in their patients.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this five-year project is to develop, validate, and deploy novel techniques for in vivo tissue microstructure characterization. These tissue microstructure measurements will be performed by collecting Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data that have been encoded to contain information about multiple tissue properties simultaneously in a manner similar to the recently introduced MR Fingerprinting technique. By optimizing the MR pulse sequence to be sensitive to variations between tissue compartments, it will be possible to collect information about microstructure which cannot currently be measured directly in vivo, including water exchange rates between tissue compartments and intracellular/extracellular volume fractions.  The specific objectives of the proposal are to: 1) Develop a technique (MRF-X) for rapid and robust in vivo quantification of volume fractions and exchange properties, 2) Characterize and validate water exchange rates and volume fraction in healthy skeletal muscle and brain tissue, 3) Explore the use of water exchange as a biomarker for disease in the brain by comparing properties of normal brain tissue and multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, and 4) Develop formal course work and laboratory experiences linking signal processing and medical imaging for undergraduate and graduate students, introduce K-12 students to biomedical imaging and engineering, and encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue science and engineering. The proposed research plan involves the development of new imaging techniques with the goal of addressing fundamental questions about the nature of interactions between tissue compartments and how they are modified under pathological conditions. Using MRF-X, it will be possible to explore tissue structure and function in healthy living tissue, and also to use these new biomarkers to aid in the understanding and diagnosis of disease. The development of a robust and rapid technique for in vivo tissue microstructure characterization will ensure that the technique is immediately translatable for clinical use, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of disease. Moreover, it will be possible to probe the underlying mechanisms of various diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer?s disease and MS, using MRF-X.

Importance of anomaly detection lies in the fact that an anomaly in the observed data may be a sign of an unwanted and often actionable event such as failure, malicious activity, etc. in the underlying system. In many real-time systems, timely and accurate detection of abnormal data patterns is crucial, and will allow proper countermeasures to be taken in a timely manner, to counteract any possible harm. Although anomaly detection has long been studied, today's complex networks exhibit new challenges, such as: low latency requirements, data size, system dynamics, unknown distributions, distributed nature, and privacy. The objective of this proposal is to investigate effective and scalable approaches for real-time data-driven anomaly detection in complex systems with these challenges. The main themes of this proposal address multiple important problems in the early detection of anomalies and attacks in a general complex network setting. Considering the importance of cybersecurity in today's world, methodologies to understand and forewarn changes in the organizational dynamics of such complicated networks is of immense significance. This proposal directly addresses these issues by bringing a fresh and novel set of engineering tools and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a systematic approach, this project first considers (1) how to timely detect anomalies in centralized high-dimensional systems with dynamicity and hidden anomaly challenges; (ii) how to deal with resource constraints in monitoring distributed systems; and (iii) how to enable privacy-preserving solutions for real-time anomaly detection in distributed systems. These challenges and the solution methods presented in this project are generally applicable to a variety of complex systems. To be specific, this project focuses on two challenging IoT networks: surveillance camera network and smart home network. The proposed approaches exploit an array of advanced techniques including sequential change detection, deep reinforcement learning, event-triggered processing, and differential privacy, and will bring significant innovations to the theory and applications of anomaly detection.

Constrained control theory is a branch of mathematics aimed at steering a dynamical system to its desired target, while also enforcing a set of safety/quality restrictions. This enabling technology allows engineering systems to live up to their full potential by operating at the limit of their specifications. Model Predictive Control (MPC) achieves this objective by solving an optimal control problem at every sampling instant. However, doing so requires a large number of computations in a relatively short amount of time, making the approach challenging to implement on high frequency engineering applications. This award supports fundamental research for the development of a new constrained control paradigm that combines systems theory, numerical methods, and algorithmic optimization to reduce the computational effort and hardware requirements of MPC.  Results from this research will enable the widespread adoption of MPC in the aerospace, automotive, energy, and robotic industries, thus benefitting the U.S. economy and society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hypersampled MPC can reduce the computational burden of traditional MPC by decoupling the prediction model, used to formulate the optimal control problem, from the control model, used to prove that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and satisfies constraints.

It is motivated by the observation that COVID-19 clusters often arise at sites involving high densities of people. Current strategies suggest coarse scale interventions to prevent this, such as cancellation of activities, which incur substantial economic and social costs. More detailed fine scaled analysis of the movement and interaction patterns of people at crowded locations can suggest interventions, such as changes to crowd management procedures and the design of built environments, that yield social distance without being as disruptive to human activities and the economy. The field of pedestrian dynamics provides mathematical models that can generate such detailed insight. However, these models need data on human behavior, which varies significantly with context and culture. This project will leverage novel data streams, such as public webcams and location based services, to inform the pedestrian dynamics model. Relevant data, models, and software will be made available to benefit other researchers working in this domain, subject to privacy restrictions. The project team will also perform outreach to decision makers so that the scientific insights yield actionable policies contributing to public health. The net result will be critical scientific insight that can generate a transformative impact on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a possible second wave, so that it protects public health while minimizing adverse effects from the interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will accomplish the above work through the following methods and innovations. LBS data can identify crowded locations at a scale of tens of meters and help screen for potential risk by analyzing the long range movement of individuals there. Worldwide video streams can yield finer-grained details of social closeness and other behavioral patterns desirable for accurate modeling. On the other hand, the videos may not be available for potentially high risk locations, nor can they directly answer \\u201cwhat-if\\u201d questions. Videos from contexts similar to the one being modeled will be used to calibrate pedestrian dynamics model parameters, such as walking speeds. Then the trajectories of individual pedestrians will be simulated in the target locations to estimate social closeness. An infection transmission model will be applied to these trajectories to yield estimates of infection spread. This will result in a novel methodology to include diverse real time data into pedestrian dynamics models so that they can quickly and accurately capture human movement patterns in new and evolving situations. The cyberinfrastructure will automatically discover real-time video streams on the Internet and analyze them to determine the pedestrian density, movements, and social distances. The pedestrian dynamics model will be reformulated from the current force-based definition to one that uses pedestrian density and individual speed, both of which can be measured effectively through video analysis.

Quantifying the processes that control boundary layer transport across the ice-ocean interface\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Sea-level rise will affect millions of people in coastal communities within the next several decades. Accurate predictions of how quickly it will rise is challenging because it depends on many different processes and how these processes interact with and feedback on each other.  One process that may play a surprisingly large role is the effect of small swirls and eddies (only a few feet across) of warm water that control the rate of ice melt at the near-vertical cliff faces of the world\\u2019s marine-terminating (tidewater) glaciers.  At these glaciers, ice flows directly into the ocean and melts underwater or calves icebergs. Melting of the ice produces freshwater that flows out near the ocean surface and drives a return flow that draws in deep warmer ocean water toward the glacier. According to current theory, increasing the rate of ice melt increases the strength at which warmer ocean water is pulled in towards the ice face, which further enhances the melting.  The details of this process - particularly the small-scale dynamics near the ice face - have never been measured because the calving ice cliffs are too dangerous to make measurements.  Here we propose to use a highly specialized underwater robot (a remotely operated vehicle, or \\u201cROV\\u201d) with state-of-the-art optical and acoustic instruments to observe the melt rate and the processes that control it.  One of the novel aspects is the use of \\u201cmelt stakes\\u201d - 6 ft long rods that will be driven into the glacier face by the ROV and monitored continuously to determine the melt processes. These stakes then provide a frame of reference for our ROV to make a suite of detailed measurements of the shape of the glacier face, the dynamics of the currents adjacent to it, and how the ice-water interface evolves.  At the same time, we will observe the local ocean environment in the fjord - the currents, salinity and temperature - which are the main ingredients we need to predict ice melt in larger-scale and climate models.   Our analyses will combine field data with a high-resolution fluid-flow model that recreates the conditions along the ice with realistic water properties.  The combination of model and data will be used to refine our melt predictions and verify these directly using our observed measurements.  At the end of the project, we will be able to extend our results to estimate how much melt is occurring for tidewater glaciers around the globe, and how this may change in time.  Beyond this importance to society and the scientific community, this grant provides broader impacts across several levels: (1) mentorship and support for two early career women (2) support for three graduate students in interdisciplinary ice-ocean studies, (3) experiential opportunities, funding, and mentorship for 45 senior-year undergraduate students, whose capstone projects will directly contribute to this project while being supervised by our gender and culturally diverse team of engineers and technical staff, (4) classroom experiments showing buoyancy and convection to engage K-12 students and the general public, and (5) two teams of high-school women will additionally be involved and make observations through Girls in Icy Fjords expeditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melting at the ice-ocean interface of marine-terminating glaciers influences the rate of mass loss from the world's ice sheets. In addition to contributing to sea-level rise, details of the melt process dictate the depth at which fresh meltwater enters the ocean (which in turn affects ocean circulation on a variety of scales) and alters calving rates. Existing theory suggests that the rate of submarine melting along these ice faces is set by the strength of subglacial discharge. However, recent observations find unexpectedly high melt rates over broad sections of glacier termini, even outside discharge plume areas.  The observed order of magnitude discrepancies between observed and predicted melt rates suggests the presence of energetic dynamics elsewhere along the ice face that drive near-ice turbulent flows.  We hypothesize that this discrepancy arises from differences in the rate-controlling physics within the boundary layers.  Current turbulent transfer coefficients were derived from stable boundary layers.  Yet on vertical glacier ice faces, boundary layers have strong buoyant forcing and marginal stability that likely produce dynamics not captured by laboratory or idealized models.  Because buoyant meltwater fluxes provide kinetic energy for near-boundary outer flows -- and because enhancement of those flows leads to enhanced melting -- there is potential for strong positive feedbacks in the dynamics.  As a result, small errors in the melt parameters or the parameterization functional form can have significant consequences to the total melt calculation. No studies have yet to make observations immediately next to near-vertical ice faces, or measure melt dynamics with the resolution necessary to investigate these dynamical feedbacks. This grant supports the development of a first-of-its-kind network of coordinated underwater acoustic, optical and in-situ unmanned sensors to be deployed at LeConte Glacier, Alaska. Using methods that meld glaciology, oceanography, and robotics, these systems will collect the first geophysical observations of the turbulent boundary layer at a near-vertical glacier face.  Specifically, we will directly measure velocity, salinity and temperature through a buoyancy-forced near-vertical boundary layer and relate these to observations of the subsurface ice morphology (e.g., slope, roughness) across several spatial scales.  By combining these data with high-resolution realistic simulations, we will characterize the dominant contributions to boundary layer turbulence and explicitly relate these to local melt rates. Our ultimate goal is to determine what parameters need to be measured (e.g., fjord u,T,S) over what time and space scales, as well as what assumptions can be made in order to connect dynamics from the small-scale ice interface to the large-scale ocean and glacier forcing.  This grant builds an observational capacity that does not exist at present.  Measurements will span a sufficient range of the parameter space (in ocean temperature, velocity variance and ice morphology) for us and others to test existing and advance new melt models that underlie many ice-ocean community models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences Program and the Physical Oceanography Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 8.03744125366211, \"y\": 5.765491485595703}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"SBIR Phase II:  Sonar Arrays for Maximizing Aquaculture Yields\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project improves cultivation practices for shrimp aquaculture.

Interaction networks can be extraordinarily complex; for example, there are over 20,000 genes in the human genome and the proteins they encode may be modified in myriad ways. Further, cellular systems often have different sub-systems that operate on multiple different scales (both temporally and in terms of copy numbers), with the species operating at one scale greatly influencing those at a different scale.

One of the challenges of supporting both the physics and engineering degree programs is teaching scientific research and engineering design using shared equipment, lab spaces, and faculty. As a unifying interdisciplinary theme that builds on the department\\u2019s strengths, the project will focus on optical measurements. New measurement devices will be designed and built that primarily use light as a precise tool to observe mechanical, thermal, and electronic processes. These devices will be used in project-based learning activities, so that students can learn physics topics and engineering design in the same laboratory facilities. Student learning outcomes will be assessed to determine the impact of the project-based learning experiences on students\\u2019 understanding of physics and their engineering design skills. The study will also examine how interdisciplinary teams of students interact and engage with research and design projects.

A suite of low-cost, compact, infrastructure-free optical techniques will be developed for project-based learning activities. These include a schlieren device compatible with a cell phone camera for imaging fluid flows and heat transfer; compact digital holography for measurements of thermal expansion and Young's modulus; and a laser power servo controller for stabilizing and modulating a laser's output. These devices will be used in undergraduate engineering courses for guided lab activities and student-led projects.  Learning assessments accompanying each device will quantify students' progress in learning course content and developing skills in experimental techniques. Additionally, optical techniques will be expanded to include more sophisticated apparatus, providing opportunities for students to engage in open-ended projects and learn aspects of engineering design. Three labs will be designed to accompany three interdisciplinary, upper-level courses, namely, fluid mechanics, a materials and devices course, and an optical science and engineering course.

However, the extent to which these data management requirements have resulted in more and better use of project data remains an open question. This project thus investigates the National Science Foundation\\u2019s DMP mandate as a national science policy and examines the broad impacts of this policy across a strategic sample of five disciplines funded by the National Science Foundation. It considers the organization and structure of DMPs across fields, the institutions involved in data sharing, data preservation practices, the extent to which DMPs enable others to use secondary project data, and the kinds of data governance and preservation practices that ensure that data are sustained and accessible. Systematic investigation of the impact of DMPs and data sharing cultures across fields will assist funding agencies and research scientists working to produce reproducible and open science by identifying barriers to data archiving, sharing, and access. The principal investigators will use project findings to develop data governance guidelines for information professionals working with scientific data and to articulate best practices for scientific communities using DMPs for data management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to enhance understanding of the role data management plans (DMPs) play in shaping data lifecycles.

In phase I, the investigators will gather a strategic sample of DMPs representing a wide range of data types and data retention practices from different scientific fields. Phase II consists of forensic data analysis of a subset of DMPs to discover what has become of project data. Phase III develops detailed case studies of research project data lifecycles and data afterlives with qualitative interviews and archival documentary analysis to help develop best practices for sustainable data preservation, access, and sharing.

Their use in practice depends on their reliability and efficiency. Reliability requires a fine-tuning of the model parameters and an accurate assessment of the sensitivity to noisy inputs. Efficiency is particularly critical in optimization problems, where the computational procedure identifies the best working conditions of a complex system.  These requirements lead to solving many times models with millions or even billions of unknowns. This process may require days or weeks of computations on high-performance computing facilities. To mitigate these costs, we need new modeling strategies that allow model-runs in minutes to hours on local computing facilities (such as a laptop).  Reduced order models (ROMs) are extremely low-dimensional approximations that can decrease the computational cost of current computational models by orders of magnitude. Having in mind biomedical and wind-engineering applications, this project proposes novel methods of model reduction. Data and numerical results from the expensive (or high-fidelity) models are combined with machine learning approaches, to obtain ROMs that attain both efficiency and accuracy at an unprecedented level. The new data-driven ROM framework will finally make possible the numerical simulation of aortic dissections, pediatric surgery, or wind farm optimization on a laptop in minutes, and aims at becoming a critical and trustworthy tool in decision-making processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data assimilation (DA), uncertainty quantification (UQ), and shape optimization (SO) are central to the development of computational models for significant biomedical and engineering applications.   Since these applications require a large number of model simulations, running an expensive full order model (FOM) is generally prohibitively expensive.  For systems that display dominant structures, reduced order models (ROMs) can decrease the FOM computational cost by orders of magnitude.   Thus, for the clinical and engineering applications above, ROMs appear as a natural and practical alternative to the prohibitively expensive FOMs running on high-performance computing facilities.   Unfortunately, to capture all the geometric scales in the hemodynamics of aortic dissections or to cope with the large Reynolds number in the wind farm optimization, hundreds and thousands of ROM modes are necessary. These relatively high-dimensional ROMs are still not viable to effectively perform DA, UQ, or SO for these applications.  What is needed is ROMs that are not only low-dimensional and efficient, but also accurate.  To develop ROMs that are accurate in realistic, under-resolved regimes, the ROM closure problem needs to be solved, i.e., the effect of the discarded ROM modes on the ROM dynamics needs to be modeled.  The proposed research puts forth a new data-driven ROM paradigm that centers around the hierarchical structure of variational multiscale (VMS) methodology and utilizes modern machine learning (ML) and numerical and observational data to develop structural ROM closures that can dramatically increase the ROM accuracy at a modest computational cost.  The novel data-driven VMS-ROM paradigm maintains the low computational cost of current ROMs but dramatically increases the ROM accuracy.  Biomedical applications in thoracic and pediatric surgery (aortic dissections and Fontan procedure \\u2013 where the fate of the patient depends significantly on the shape of the vessels) as well as wind-engineering applications are specifically targeted. The data-driven VMS-ROM framework will finally make possible the efficient DA, UQ, and SO in these and, possibly, other fields relying on mathematical and computational modeling.

However, nanoscale science and engineering often requires the use of complex and expensive tools and facilities for the fabrication and characterization of these materials and devices. This necessitates the support of shared national resources for both basic research in academic institutions and the translation of these discoveries into commercial products by small and large enterprises. As part of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) program, the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor (SENIC) establishes a partnership between the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, an academic collaboration between North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCA&amp;T) and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). This national resource provides open access to nanofabrication and characterization facilities and tools along with expert staff support to a growing user community across the southeastern U.S. The SENIC infrastructure will strengthen and accelerate discovery in nanoscience and nanoengineering, addressing important national research priorities including the NSF 10 Big Ideas encompassing topics such as quantum science, convergence research, and biomedical technologies. In addition, because societal and economic needs require a skilled workforce trained in the tools and techniques of nanotechnology, SENIC implements a comprehensive education and outreach program, embedded with lessons in social and ethical responsibility, designed to reach a broad and diverse audience of students, teachers and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;With access to 350 nanotechnology fabrication and characterization tools, SENIC's goal is to provide a one-stop-shop approach, covering both top-down approaches using nanoscale patterning, as well as bottom-up approaches based on nanomaterials synthesis and additive processing. Programs and activities are designed to address user awareness, accessibility, and affordability. SENIC will operate with an interdisciplinary culture where engineers, scientists, physicians, educators, policy experts, and economic development professionals work together with shared access to facilities and tools and a deep understanding of industry opportunities and societal challenges to promote the accelerated translation of invention into innovation. In addition, SENIC will work in partnership with the other sites in the NNCI network to create a research ecosystem that is strengthened by collaboration, sharing of best practices, scholarly interaction, and mutual support. Furthermore, the SENIC partners will work with undergraduate and graduate students, as well as partner with 2-year technical colleges, to produce science and engineering professionals from diverse backgrounds who are ready to meet the global workforce demands of the 21st century. In tandem, our outreach activities, teacher training, and public awareness events will encourage K-12 students, targeting schools and districts with underserved populations, to participate in the STEM pipeline and will help create an informed citizenry that supports the safe and responsible development of nanotechnology.

This raises the intriguing possibility that, far from being hard-wired, the effects of testosterone (and other hormones) on growth and other processes may change considerably during evolution. This project will test for such \\\"evolutionary reversals\\\" in the hormonal regulation of growth across lizard species.  These species have been selected to span repeated evolutionary shifts between those in which males are larger and those in which females are larger. By simultaneously characterizing the effects of testosterone on the expression of thousands of genes, this project will also determine how such \\\"evolutionary reversals\\\" in the hormonal regulation of growth are accomplished at the genetic level. The results of this collaborative study will broaden understanding of the endocrine system.  It may also challenge generalizations derived from traditional animal models by investigating how closely related species evolve different responses to the same hormone.

This project will combine hormone manipulations and high-throughput RNA sequencing aimed at (1) characterizing how the expression of growth-regulatory gene networks differs with respect to age, tissue, and hormone treatment using detailed experiments on three focal lizard species, (2) testing for evolutionary reversals in the hormonal regulation of growth and gene expression by extending these methods to a broader, phylogenetically informed sampling of related lizard species with variable patterns of sexual dimorphism in body size (male-larger or female-larger), and (3) characterizing rates of sequence evolution for thousands of expressed genes to test whether the specificity of expression that is achieved by hormonal regulation also frees coding sequences themselves to evolve more quickly.

The project proposes a new paradigm, Deep Constrained Learning, to solve these large-scale optimization problems in real time, while ensuring efficient and reliable grid operations.

The cells and tissues that make up living organisms have material properties just like any other substance. When exposed to mechanical forces, such as pulling or pushing, they stretch and change shape. They can even generate these forces themselves.  The material properties of cells are controlled by the cytoskeleton, a collection of filamentous proteins. This network of filaments gives cells their shape, much like the skeleton defines the human shape. In cells, however, this network is dynamic and adaptive, reorganizing itself to help cells perform various functions or to resist outside mechanical stresses. The cytoskeleton thus represents a new class of material that doesn't obey the traditional models of engineering materials. It can modulate its material properties in both space and time.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will determine how the cell is able to spatially and temporally regulate its material properties and unearth novel design principles that can be used to develop new engineering materials and to understand how some diseases affect cell behavior. Sitting at the interface between physics, biology, and engineering, this multi-disciplinary work will inform research across a broad spectrum of fields. Most importantly, it will create opportunities for a diverse set of students and young researchers to develop innovative skills and perspectives, in particular learning to communicate novel methods and ideas across disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cytoskeleton is a model system for developing insights into non-equilibrium mechanics and network dynamics, and is known to both generate and respond to mechanical signals. Despite the fact that the principal molecular biochemical interactions have been well detailed, we still lack an understanding of how macroscopic scale behaviors emerge from the collection of many molecular interactions. Septins are the least studied filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. They bind to both actin and the plasma membrane, and have been shown to localize specifically to regions of actin curvature and mechanical stress. This research project will test the hypothesis that septins help to regulate the material properties of the cytoskeleton by altering the local architecture. This work will measure the material properties of septin-actin networks in both living cells and purified protein networks, and test the response of these networks to mechanical perturbations such as micropatterning to control cell shape, traction force microscopy, and optogenetics to induce local contractions.

The semiconductor industry relies on process control to maintain high yield and to prevent the propagation of faults through the manufacturing process.  Semiconductor inspection represents a market of nearly $5 B in size and generates an estimated 15% of spending in the semiconductor industry.

Enormous public data now are available including the 1,000 Genome Project, the 100K Genome Project, the 1001 Arabidopsis Genomes project, the Rice Genome Annotation Project, and the Bird 10,000 Genomes (B10K) Project.   Key software, called short read aligners, align newly sequenced DNA fragments to one (or more) reference genome(s) in order to identify genetic variation within the species.  The downstream analysis of this genetic variation finds causal relationships between complex diseases and phenotypes.  Existing short read aligners are unable to align to a large number of reference genome(s), due purely to computational constraints. Hence, using a small number of genome(s) to align to reduces the memory and time constraints.   Unfortunately, although there is a large percentage genetic similarity between individuals of the same species, the differences are also important and aligning to only a small number of genomes of a given species can lead to some of the DNA fragments not aligning or aligning poorly.  This, in turn, makes finding genetic variation between the newly sequenced DNA fragments and the reference genome(s) more challenging. One manner to overcome this challenge is to develop new algorithms and data structures for short read alignment that reduce the computational resources. This project realizes this vision by developing a novel representation of a population of genomes, and creating the algorithms and data structures needed to build, store and update it. Thus, integrated into this project is the goal of advancing biological science and knowledge of model species, and the ideas, and furthering the development of an outreach program that supports first-generation university graduates. An immediate outcome of the work will be research opportunities to under-served students through the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars program, an organization that aims to foster the success of first-generation university scholars.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short read aligners first build an index from one or more reference genome(s) and subsequently use it to find and extend matched subsequences between sequence reads and the reference(s). The bottleneck of using these read aligners to index thousands of genomes is the space and time needed for construct and store the index.  To address the shortcomings associated with using a single reference genome, the concept of graph-based pangenomics aligners has been introduced and widely discussed in the community. Although such methods have been shown to improve on the accuracy over standard sequence-based aligners, their use has not been fully explored.  The challenge that prevents the realization a pangenomics graph alignment is that of scalability. The goal of the project is to the developing algorithms that allow for the construction of a pangenomic reference from datasets gathered from large populations.  In order to achieve this goal, novel means to build, compress, and update a graph that encapsulates the variation found in the population will be created and implemented. Thus, this work will require further advancements that have impact beyond the stated application. More specifically, it is unknown how to merge the r-index, represent a graph-model of references using sub-linear space, or represent the graph using the r-index. This project will address these open problems, and more broadly, connect two areas of research: succinct data structures and pangenomics.   Next, the project will minimize the conceptual gap between compression and mutability.  The research community has struggled with the balance between compression and mutability since highly compressed data structures are not able to be altered without reconstruction.  This poses unduly constraints when trying to apply these structures to biological datasets that routinely get updated with new data.   This project will make significant developments in this area by developing compressed data structures that are mutable for our realization of our pangenomics index.

The project also explores the effect of atomic imperfections in the semiconductors on the movement of free electrical charge. This program also links the research with the educational goal of increasing learning opportunities for students of all ages, inside and outside the traditional classroom. The investigators and students involved in this project participate in outreach activities organized either in-house or at local schools to increase exposure of K-12 students and the general public to modern scientific topics in materials science in a fun, project-oriented environment. Lesson plans are designed and experimental demonstrations of basic optical properties of matter are built for the middle-school summer camp \\u201cPhysics Inside Out\\u201d at Purdue. To maximize impact at the high-school level, the activities engage teachers in summer research. In particular, the teachers are developing inquiry-based lesson plans incorporating concepts related to quantum science into the high-school curriculum to fulfill Indiana standards.

These semiconductors have unique electronic properties that make them suitable for advancing the functionality of semiconductor optoelectronic devices into spectral ranges currently inaccessible with other material systems. The innovative approach employs an emergent optoelectronic material, the wurtzite phase of Sc-Al-nitride that is lattice-matched to GaN, to mitigate strain-related issues that have impeded progress of nitride optoelectronics into the infrared so far. The research effort is interdisciplinary and involves material design and growth, plus structural and optical characterization. Polar and nonpolar ScAlN/GaN heterostructures are designed using extensive band-structure calculations. To achieve maximum material purity and monolayer-control of the atomic structure, the Sc-containing materials are grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on high quality quasi-bulk GaN substrates. The decisive task is to identify the epitaxial growth conditions that satisfy the most stringent requirements imposed by near-infrared optical processes. In order to correlate microstructure with optical and electronic properties, the structure of the semiconductor materials is comprehensively characterized with high-resolution x-ray diffraction, advanced transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography. The band structure of the materials is probed experimentally with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The growth of these emergent materials advances the state-of-the-art in transition-metal nitride epitaxy. Uncharted mechanisms of material growth on polar and non-polar GaN substrates are scrutinized. This research also contributes to the knowledge base of the physics of infrared optical transitions. These infrared materials are expected to enable optoelectronics with functionality unmatched by current technologies. Moreover, the novel class of Sc-containing semiconductors benefit other applications such as high-electron mobility transistors, ultraviolet, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and plasmonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.319516181945801, \"y\": 8.020498275756836}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CNS Core: Small: Paxos Unpacked\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Due to their excellent fault-tolerance properties, Paxos protocols have been employed by many cloud computing systems for consistent coordination of clusters of computers.

The high collision rate between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate has built up a series of hills and mountains called a fold-and-thrust belt in western Taiwan. There have been at least 10 powerful earthquakes in this belt in the last 100 years. Every year, more than 1.6 inches of plate shortening is accommodated by this fold-and-thrust belt, making western Taiwan an ideal natural laboratory for understanding how mountains are built and earthquakes are generated. This three-year proposal supports two tenure-track early career faculty members and a female graduate student to broaden diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.

(3) Can we use seismology, geodesy, and numerical modeling to identify active faults and calculate slip budget in different parts of the fold-and-thrust belts in western Taiwan? The team uses more than 15 years of continuous Global Navigation Satellite Systems (cGNSS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) displacement in order to estimate three-dimensional surface deformation with about hundred-feet spatial resolution in the Western Foothills in Taiwan. They also take advantage of the high-resolution seismic data from the Taiwanese seismic catalog to compare with GNSS and InSAR measurements.

Large earthquakes often rupture across tens to hundreds of miles of faults, including stepovers (gaps) between fault segments and bends in faults. These fault irregularities can also stop rupture propagation. So, they play an important role in understanding earthquake hazard assessment. Whether or not an earthquake rupture is able to pass through a given stepover or a bend is very important. Previous studies have suggested that stepovers more than about 5 km wide would stop rupture propagation, but some recent large earthquakes have jumped wider gaps. The 2016 magnitude 7.8 New Zealand earthquake, for example, involved rupture jumping over a gap more than 15 km wide between faults. This project will use tectonic fault models to simulate the initial stress field, especially around stepovers and bends, and then use the results to improve fault rupture models. Results of this project will improve our understanding of large earthquakes and their hazards, particularly within continents where fault systems are complex. This research will train two graduate students in the emerging field of multiphysics in faulting and earthquakes. Undergraduate students will be involved through senior thesis research, and research results, including animations of fault ruptures, will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at Texas A&amp;M and the University of Missouri, and be freely available to other educators. Computer codes developed in this project will be freely shared with other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use numerical models to simulate fault rupture and propagation along stepovers and bends, the fault irregularities that often stop fault rupture, hence limiting the size of earthquakes. Knowing whether or not a given stepover or bend can stop fault rupture propagation is critical for hazard assessment, because large earthquakes, especially those on intracontinental strike-slip faults, usually rupture multiple fault segments by jumping over stepovers and propagating along fault bends. Previous numerical modeling and some field observations have suggested that stepovers more than ~5 km wide would stop fault rupturing; however, ruptures in the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand jumped more than 15 km between faults. Fault geometry and initial stress are among the most important factors dictating rupture behavior, but initial stress is often poorly constrained and simplified as homogeneous or ad hoc heterogeneous in previous dynamic rupture models. On the other hand, it is well known that stress tends to concentrate around stepovers, bends, and other fault irregularities. This project will use fault tectonics models to simulate changes of regional static stress around stepovers and bends, and quasi-static stress changes due to previous slip events. The resulting stress fields will then be used in dynamic rupture models to simulate spontaneous propagation of fault ruptures during earthquakes. The research will use generic fault models to explore key parameters controlling rupture along stepovers and bends, and then a model based on the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake will be developed to gain insights into complex ruptures involving multiple faults. Results of this project will improve our understanding of large earthquakes and their hazards, particularly within continents where fault systems are complex and large events often involve rupture of multiple faults or segments.

The investigators consider how the spatial distribution of parasite genomic sampling locations impacts estimated migration patterns and determine whether the mapped migration paths are still meaningful even when there is an irregular distribution of sampling locations. The research provides insights on how to include locally known migration barriers as well as other relevant natural or built environmental features into mapped migration estimates. As public health officials work toward reducing and eventually eliminating malaria, local information about factors driving malaria risk is important for prioritizing resources and optimizing control and elimination strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken using computational methods that generate estimated effective migration surfaces. These methods use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to estimate migration and create migration contours that can be mapped to show relative high or low areas of gene flow. This research will integrate local spatial features to improve gene flow estimates and account for possible barriers thereby reducing spatial uncertainty that is commonplace in current maps of parasite migration. A set of analyses will be undertaken to determine the robustness of parasite migration surface estimates to varying spatial distributions of genomic data sample locations. This research is expected to not only have a profound impact for local public health officials tasked with eliminating P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria but will transform the ability of a broader group of researchers to produce parasite migration estimates for other kinds of species at local scales and provide new computational tools for studying parasite migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.068531036376953, \"y\": 5.298192501068115}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CIF: Small: Machine Learning for Wireless Propagation Channels\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Wireless communications is an essential part of modern society, and with the introduction of 5G, will become even more important. One of the key challenges of wireless communications is that the signals are distorted on their way from the transmitter to the receiver, i.e., by the propagation channel. In order to make communications efficient, the system needs to know and correct these distortions at the receiver. The current way of getting this information is through sending special, known signals, from which the distortion information can be extracted. However this is highly inefficient as useful (payload) data cannot be sent during this time. These challenges are further exacerbated if the distortion information needs to be known at the transmitter, or when prediction of what the distortions will be in the future is needed, or in a different frequency band, or at different locations. This project explores the use of powerful identification and prediction techniques in Machine Learning (ML) to make such predictions. The project team will combine knowledge about the physics of propagation channels and extensive measurement data to train the ML algorithms together with novel ML training approaches to tackle this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, the structure of wireless channels is very different from structures of other types of data (images, documents, etc.) to which ML has been applied. Thus application of ML to wireless channels cannot simply apply modern training algorithms (e.g. deep learning) known from image classification and other well-known ML applications, but rather requires incorporation of the special properties of wireless propagation and suitable rethinking of the ML approaches. The project will thus develop new methodologies, and provide new insights, both from the perspective of ML and that of propagation channels and their impact on system design.

Molecular electronics aims at developing devices that will complement and eventually supersede current semiconductor technologies. Molecular transport junctions have unique advantages, due to their hybrid solid state-molecular nature and novel interface properties. The variety of possible combinations of molecules and electrodes also permits tailoring the transport properties. Electrically gating charge transport was key to the electronics revolution, but no mechanism currently exists to effectively gate molecular transport junctions. This project will address that gap through a systematic probe of the factors related to electric transport. This will improve the fundamental understanding of these novel devices and enable a new gating mechanism to control electric transport with an unprecedented level of control. This will allow for integration of specific functions into molecular junctions that will enable practical applications. These include bio-photonics and optoelectronic device such as solar cells and LEDs at the single molecule level.

Most embryos develop in fluids with buoyancy, a force that only exists when there is gravity. Many species are pseudo-symmetric, and as such, breaking the left-right symmetry is essential for proper development. For example, axial rotation occurs in the development of many mammals and birds, and is one of the earliest developmental events that breaks the left-right symmetry. During axial rotation, the embryonic brain undergoes rotation to correctly place the organs.  If it fails to do this correctly, significant birth defects can result. The research goal of this award is to understand how body forces such as gravity and buoyancy affect embryonic development and symmetry breaking. The project will examine how the absence of buoyancy and gravity change the growth and brain torsion in chicken embryos in experiments to be conducted on the International Space Station. These experiments, together with computational simulations, will be employed to identify the key mechanical factors driving axial rotation. The research results will be incorporated into solid mechanics and biomechanics courses, and the development of high school and undergraduate research experiences. Computational models will be made available on a website, and videos of this research will be uploaded to YouTube. An annual workshop will be held to host visitors and share scientific knowledge.

Physical forces drive and regulate the twisting of the brain. Thus, the idea that brain torsion not only depends on body curvature (flexure) and the forces exerted by the vitelline membrane, but is also a result of heart development and body forces such as gravity and buoyancy will be explored. The hypothesis that buoyancy helps the heart and brain tube maintain the right morphology, and that the disturbance in buoyancy or heart development will be detrimental for symmetry breaking and embryonic development will be tested. The work will unveil new mechanical aspects of morphogenesis and develop new models for embryonic development that take into account the effects of body forces.

It is widely recognized that a major disruption is currently under way in the design of computer systems as processors strive to extend, and go beyond, the end-game of Moore\\u2019s Law. This disruption is manifest in new forms of heterogeneous and distributed processors and memories at all scales (on-chip, on-die, on-node, on-rack, on-cluster, and on-data-center), rendering scalability as a fundamental challenge at all levels.  Healthcare analytics offers a unique opportunity to explore scalable system design for the 21st century because there has been a tectonic shift in the ability of medical institutions to capture and store medical data, and to even stream data in real time. This shift has already contributed to an ecosystem of Machine Learning (ML) models being trained for a variety of clinical tasks. A new distributed heterogeneous architecture is required to build systems that can develop and deploy ML models based on distributed healthcare data that must necessarily be accessed with privacy-preserving constraints. Further, the proposed architecture must be accompanied by a software framework that can address the needs of domain-specific data scientists to develop and augment ML models being deployed in their hospitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant project is exploring the foundational principles necessary in building integrated scalable distributed systems of the future, so as to prepare for submitting a full proposal to the PPoSS program.

The exploration focuses on demonstrating an integrated platform that spans multiple levels of distribution and heterogeneity of computation and storage, while also obeying important  privacy constraints. While recent progress on the use of ML in healthcare applications has been encouraging, current approaches do not a) scale to the degrees of parallelism, heterogeneity, and distribution that will be required in future systems, or b) support the soft real-time responsiveness to streaming data that is needed in many clinical situations. The originality of this project can be seen in the integration of distribution, heterogeneity, and privacy considerations in a single unified software/hardware stack, which includes adaptive resource management that spans privacy-preserving federated continuous learning, automatic specialization of ML models at individual sites, and automatic selection of ML models best suited for specific clinical tasks that maximize accuracy subject to different latency and soft real-time constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project\\u2019s end-to-end approach to develop foundational scalability principles will impact multiple areas of computer science through publications, tutorials and courses, thereby benefiting other researchers working on scalability challenges in future distributed heterogeneous systems.

End-of-life poses a large security risk if disposed-of devices still contain sensitive data and end up in the wrong hands. Data security is also important for sustainability:  A  consumer concerned about privacy may store a device or recycle it, instead of selling for reuse. Many devices turned in for recycling are not reused because the device and data cannot readily be cleared for a new user. Decreased reuse has economic, social and environmental impacts.

The usability of data wiping protocols is evaluated to clarify how easy and effective it is to remove personal data from different devices. The results from these activities leads to construction of a model predicting security and end-of-use behaviors for different consumer groups.

Currently, there is a lack of devices that continuously monitor lead on the market. As a result, in multiple cities across the US, thousands of children are exhibit increased lead concentration in their blood. This project will develop a lead monitoring system for drinking water that will be accessible, inexpensive, and simple to operate in households. The device will operate in a similar manner to a fire alarm alerting households when lead concentrations exceed safe levels. The innovations in this research will enhance the scientific and technological understanding of mechanisms and devices to detect low concentrations of toxic metals in water. The proposed research will build an Accademia-Industry partnership needed to address lead poisoning in drinking water through continued monitoring by an advanced sensor. The industrial partner commits to commercializing the technology from the proposed research and to bring the sensor to the market. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is focused on creating a sensor and related technology for measuring lead concentrations in drinking water. Reliable detection and quantification of low concentrations of lead in water is a challenging but important task, given the negative health impacts of this heavy metal, particularly on children. Currently, there is a lack of continuously monitoring lead devices on the market. To address this, a new sensing element is proposed based on carbon nanotube fibers that lower the limit of detection and allow the sensor electrode to be miniaturized. The sensor uses an electrochemical analytical technique to sense lead in water. This approach offers simultaneous multielement detection for lead, copper, cadmium and mercury with 3.5 parts per trillion limit of detection for lead, outperforming any similar devices.  Due to its simplicity and compactness, the sensor allows deployment in industrial facilities processing water as well as in households. Factors that control the reliability and robustness of the sensors and electrochemical reactions will be determined in preparation of the device for mass production by a leading national water processing industry.

Irregular heart rhythms or arrhythmias are one of the most common causes for cardiovascular death. Arrhythmia-related cardiac morbidity and mortality can be reduced by the implantation of permanent cardiac devices that are designed to monitor the heart rhythm for serious abnormalities and to deliver immediate therapy when necessary. In the United States, nearly 225,000 pacemakers or other cardiac rhythm management devices (CRMD) are implanted annually. Device manufacturers have recently started incorporating advanced features to make the cardiac devices smarter and more connected. In the treatment of arrhythmia, the identification of the specific nature of arrhythmia is critical. At present the implantable cardiac devices have the capability only to detect the presence of an arrhythmia not to identify which kind of arrhythmia. Because of this shortcoming in current implantable devices, it is possible that they may administer the wrong corrective measure for the type of arrhythmia. This lack of specific treatment can have devastating consequences. Thus, energy efficient arrhythmia detection and identification is critical to next generation implantable cardiac devices. The results of this research work will have the potential to significantly impact the way patients suffering from arrhythmia are diagnosed and treated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRMDs are severely energy constrained devices. Any new added features will drain more charge from the battery and will reduce the battery life of the implanted cardiac devices. In this research, the team will explore energy-efficient novel artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for real-time detection and identification of arrhythmia in connected smart implantable cardiac devices. Further, the feasibility of ultra-low power hardware implementation of the developed algorithms will be explored. The main novelty of this research lies in using statistical models and algorithms and in using energy efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) for arrhythmia detection and identification. The developed AI algorithm hardware can be optimized for energy efficiency by reduction of computation size and by reduction of number of computations. The research results are expected to enable the cardiac device manufacturers to develop the next generation of implantable cardiac devices capable of identifying arrythmias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.9929447174072266, \"y\": 7.55155086517334}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Dry-Wet Phase Inversion Pathway of Graphene Oxide (GO)-Based Mixed-Matrix Membranes for Mineral Ions Separation by Membrane Distillation\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Increasing pollution and water scarcity have created the need to access and recover unconventional water sources. One such source is high-salinity produced water, which surfaces from underground during oil or gas production. Produced water has an excess concentration of minerals and does not meet the regulatory standards of acceptable quality for drinking water. However, by removing these undesirable constituents, the produced water can be reused for agricultural applications such as irrigation, livestock watering, and aquaculture. Therefore, identifying a process to desalinate produced water is of great societal importance. Reverse osmosis is a pressure-driven membrane process used to desalinate water containing relatively low mineral concentrations, such as groundwater. The mineral concentrations of produced water are sufficiently high that reverse osmosis is unsuitable for desalination. Membrane distillation is a promising alternative technology capable of separating minerals from high-salinity water due to its unique thermal-membrane characteristics. Graphene oxide-based membranes, with their efficient antifouling properties, are expected to enhance the membrane distillation process. Graphene oxide-based membranes are fabricated using a state-of-the-art method called phase inversion. Phase inversion produces these membranes by integrating graphene oxide directly into the polymeric materials. This project sets out to develop a detailed fundamental and mechanistic understanding of the role that graphene oxide plays in a novel dry-wet phase inversion synthesis to produce membranes for membrane distillation. This project will also combine research and education activities to train a new generation of experts in the versatile area of membrane technology, particularly as applied to water treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membrane technology for water desalination and treatment of produced water has the potential to fundamentally alter the way society views water reuse. Augmenting water treatment capacity will allow rural, arid, and isolated regions with limited access to water, to have portable and reliable membrane systems for treating water. Advancing promising membrane separation processes for desalination, such as membrane distillation, requires access to fundamental knowledge of functional materials and structure-property relationship to engineer effective membranes. Membrane distillation is an energy-efficient alternative to multi-stage flash and multi-effect distillation processes and can be configured to concentrate brines. However, application of membrane distillation at scale is limited by the lack of suitable membranes exhibiting high permeate flux, water recovery, and resistance to scaling. The goal of this project is to establish and understand the dry-wet phase inversion membrane development approach to overcome these limitations in utility for produced water purification. Graphene oxide is a versatile anti-fouling nanomaterial that will be used in the synthesis of mixed-matrix membranes with properties specific to application in membrane distillation. Three research objectives are defined to provide fundamental insights into the dry-wet phase inversion process. In the first objective, the investigators will establish the role of graphene oxide sheet pH on pore formation and hydrophobic properties and determine the mechanism of dispersion of graphene oxide. The second objective examines ion retention on dry-wet phase inversion graphene oxide-based membranes during membrane distillation. And the third objective focuses on characterizing of the chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability of the dry-wet phase inversion graphene oxide-based membranes. Together, this knowledge will form a foundation for advancing membrane distillation for high-salinity water purification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.277158737182617, \"y\": 6.871532917022705}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"An Interdisciplinary Team-based Framework to Engage Undergraduate Students in Biomedical Innovation\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project aims to serve the national interest by improving the preparation of biomedical engineers.

In these areas, one tectonic plate dives into the Earth\\u2019s mantle underneath another plate. As the two plates slip and grind against each other, shallow earthquakes - as well as deep earthquakes occurring at depths greater than ~60 km (and up to ~700-km depths) - are produced along the down-going slab. The mechanism by which deep earthquakes occur is still unclear and being debated. Here, the researchers analyze seismic waves produced by deep earthquakes in a subduction zone in Japan. Seismic waves travel through the mantle and crust, carrying information about their sources (the earthquakes) and the properties of rocks along their paths to the surface. The team focuses on the properties of the subducting slab, namely its anisotropy. Flows in the Earth\\u2019s mantle deform the constitutive rocks which can develop rock fabrics such as crystal preferred orientations and aligned inclusions. When a rock presents a strong fabric, its properties for the propagation of seismic waves often show some anisotropy. It means that they depend on the orientation of the wave propagation direction within the rock.  By analyzing the characteristic of seismic shear waves, and comparing them with modeled predictions, the researchers infer the location of the rock fabric for the subducting plate interface. They gradually unveil the structure and dynamics of subduction zones.  This project provides support and training for two graduate students and a postdoctoral associate at University of Houston. It also provides educational outreach to K-12 students and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismic anisotropy can influence both earthquake seismic-wave radiation patterns and shear wave splitting. Here, the team uses deep earthquake radiation patterns (aka moment tensors) to map for high-resolution anisotropy inside the slab. The researchers also verify the existence of the inferred anisotropy by making forward predictions for the splitting pattern of a shear wave propagating through the anisotropic slab.  Predictions are then compared with observations. They make the predictions using a propagator-matrix method and a 3D full-wave anisotropic elastic finite-difference code. Preliminary results show that for a seismic station above an anisotropic subducting slab, the predicted fast-S polarization can be either trench-parallel or trench-perpendicular depending on the incident angle of the S wave; a pattern which has also been observed in seismic data. The work outcomes shed new light on the understanding of the anisotropic rock fabric in the subducting slab and the deep earthquakes.

What the relation is between the discrete and continuous \\\"worlds\\\", how one impacts the other, and what laws they obey are the fundamental questions that the PI intends to investigate. This project focuses on the Hamming cube, the simplest discrete object that consists of binary strings of given length and that can encode any complex information. As the complexity of the information increases, the lengths of the encoded strings increase exponentially. The goal of the project is to develop mathematics on the Hamming cube that would allow us to encode the structures of the continuous world into the discrete world, and vice versa. The new techniques developed could have surprising applications in complexity theory as well as classical and quantum algorithms. Many of these problems are accessible to students and this project aims to continue the PI's work with undergraduate and graduate students in this area.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will consider a series of problems in the Gauss space and, most importantly, in its discrete counterpart, the Hamming cube. Unlike the classical case of the unit circle, many fundamental questions of Fourier analytic type are still open for the Hamming cube due to its unique discrete geometric structure. The first and main direction of the proposal is to resolve Weissler's conjecture, an old open problem in complex hypercontractivity theory on the Boolean cube that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness of the Hermite operator with complex time. Weissler's conjecture has important implications in several areas of mathematics including combinatorics, computer science, probability, isoperimetry, and approximation theory. The new techniques will be based on developing \\\"two-point\\\" inequalities. The second  direction of this research is to develop methods of harmonic analysis to find good estimates on the norms of various linear operators acting on a class of functions on the Hamming cube whose Fourier spectra belong to given prescribed sets. The basic examples include Bernstein-Markov type inequalities and their reverse forms for functions on the Hamming cube that live on the low and high frequencies respectively. The third direction is to understand the universality phenomena of the Gaussian measure. In particular, the goal is to investigate uniqueness of the functional Ehrhard inequality, which is the sharp analog of Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the Gaussian measure. The analysis will be based on Monge-Ampere type partial differential equations and semigroup methods.

This study will test whether a portion of the lower crust detached from the overlying tectonic plate and subsequently sank into the mantle below, causing the overlying rocks to be uplifted towards the surface, or alternatively whether movement along steep faults resulted in their exhumation. To evaluate these hypotheses, rock samples will be collected and evaluated to give information on when, and at what rates, these deep rocks were translated towards the surface.

In the North American Cordilleran orogen in central Idaho, the Salmon River suture zone is a ~30 kilometer-wide region that experienced Jurassic-Early Cretaceous contractional deformation associated with collision of a volcanic island arc terrane with the western edge of the North American continent. Rocks in the suture zone record structural burial to and subsequent exhumation from depths as great as 40 kilometers, and therefore are ideal for investigating the processes that drive high-magnitude exhumation during accretionary events. This project will test two primary hypotheses: 1) Rocks in the Salmon River suture zone were exhumed via hinged unroofing following lithospheric delamination, which predicts contemporaneous exhumation-related cooling across the width of the suture zone and eastward-increasing exhumation rates and magnitudes; or 2) Rocks in the Salmon River suture zone were exhumed via forward-breaking thrust propagation, which predicts a systematic westward younging of the timing of peak burial, initial exhumation, and motion on thrust faults. To test these hypotheses, this project will integrate structural analysis and geochronology of field relationships, the timing and pressure-temperature conditions of peak metamorphism, and multi-part temperature-time paths as a proxy for exhumation-related cooling.

Furthermore, it can ultimately be used in other surgical interventions, such as pannus retention, wound management, and liposuction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for a less invasive and more reliable method for lifting the abdominal wall during laparoscopic surgery. Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using invasive perforating towel clips. With manual grasp it can be difficult for the surgeon to maintain grip and proper elevation, especially with lean or obese patients. Alternatively, using perforating towel clips is invasive because the towel clips perforate the abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The perforations can be a significant source of post-op discomfort and bruising for the patient. This project focuses on developing a medical device that uses suction to attach to and lift the abdominal wall more reliably than manual grasp and less invasively than perforating towel clips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.342074394226074, \"y\": 7.054013252258301}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"The Critical Digital Pedagogy Project: Teacher Preparation for Inquiry-Based Online STEM Education\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project aims to serve the national interest of improving STEM teaching and learning by identifying and integrating critical digital pedagogy methods to prepare pre-service teachers to teach inquiry-based STEM education effectively in online learning environments. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, both K-12 and higher education underwent a dramatic shift to primarily online instruction. With the realization that multiple modes of instruction are possible, pre-service teacher programs must prepare students to teach in online environments. This IUSE Engaged Student Learning Level 1 project seeks to combine inquiry-based approaches to learning with critical digital pedagogy. It supports Carroll University faculty members in transforming their teaching to facilitate inquiry-based STEM education in online learning environments. In turn, this is expected to improve undergraduate STEM teaching and learning for pre-service teachers at Carroll University, as education faculty will integrate critical digital pedagogy methods into their K-12 STEM methods courses. Critical digital pedagogy impels the reimagining of how and where learning occurs, and how all students and teachers, regardless of culture, ability, or boundaries are empowered (Stommel, 2014). When combined with inquiry-based learning the approach offers the opportunity to address meaningful real-world problems in ways that require critical and creative thinking and emphasize community and collaboration. Such an integrated and sustained multidisciplinary perspective is intended to prepare Carroll pre-service teachers to teach inquiry-based K-12 STEM education in a variety of delivery methods, including in fully online learning environments. The long-term goal is to develop a critical digital pedagogy model that prepares pre-service teachers to facilitate the learning of STEM concepts and processes in online learning environments that are equitable and inclusive of all learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of inquiry-based practices that value active learning, immersion in authentic settings, engagement in reasoning and problem solving, and the development of creativity are shown to facilitate effective student learning. However, the implementation of these pedagogical methods and the accompanying research are contextualized within in-person learning environments. Therefore, this project\\u2019s first objective is to identify best practices for incorporating critical digital pedagogy into inquiry-based, online STEM education for pre-service teachers, and begin integrating these new instructional techniques into methods courses.  A second objective is to increase STEM and education faculty members\\u2019 efficacy around the incorporation of critical digital pedagogy into methods courses for pre-service teachers.  The third objective is to use new instructional techniques to improve pre-service teachers\\u2019 sense of efficacy for effectively teaching inquiry-based STEM education in online learning environments. This project emphasizes examination of equity and access issues in tandem with instructional changes to ensure all students can access these learning opportunities in both K-12 and higher education settings.

Starch is the major carbon storage form of plants, a main source of calories in the human diet, and an important raw material for various industrial applications. Despite the importance of starch in biological systems and in human society, our understanding of the regulation of starch metabolism is surprisingly limited and far from complete. Transitory starch, a primary product of photosynthesis, accumulates in plant leaves during the day, and is degraded at night to provide energy for cellular activities and plant growth. Starch degradation is a complex process that requires the combined activity of several protein families including glucan phosphatases, glucan dikinases, and amylases. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding how these proteins specifically contribute to starch degradation. This research project will investigate the role that glucan phosphatases play in initiating and regulating transitory starch degradation. A complete understanding of the molecular events that control starch degradation is necessary to define novel strategies to improve starch yields in crops, a raw material for biofuel and various industrial and agricultural applications. Undergraduate researchers working on this project, some of whom will be from underrepresented and minority populations, will be provided the opportunity to engage in structural biochemistry and metabolomics research, travel to national conferences to present their work, and collaborate closely with experts in the field. Thus, this project will provide mentorship and training for the next generation of scientists and help retain both underserved and underrepresented students in the sciences. This research will also contribute to biochemistry undergraduate education through the design of a project-based laboratory course. Overall, the project represents a robust combination of advancing foundational research, improving undergraduate education, and positively impacting future agricultural and industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starch is an insoluble polymer of glucose. Phosphorylation of the starch outer glucosyl residues by glucan dikinases makes the starch granule partially water soluble and accessible to starch degrading enzymes such as \\uf062-amylases. The subsequent removal of phosphate groups by glucan phosphatases is necessary for complete starch breakdown. By employing a variety of structural, biophysical, and biochemical techniques, the project will investigate the various steps in starch dephosphorylation and its undefined roles in regulating starch degradation. Specifically, the project aims to understand 1) the mechanisms by which glucan phosphatases contribute to the regulation of starch degradation; 2) the structural basis of glucan dephosphorylation at the starch granule; and 3) the critical roles of starch dephosphorylation in diurnal starch metabolism. By employing metabolomics, the project will explore the direct and indirect roles of starch phosphorylation in starch metabolism under abiotic stress. The results of this research project will help close the knowledge gap in understanding the roles and regulatory mechanisms of the glucan phosphatase family of enzymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.569498062133789, \"y\": 5.85650110244751}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: Genomic Data Science: From Informational Limits to Efficient Algorithms\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have paved the way for a revolution in the biological and medical sciences. By sequencing the human genome, one can learn about the genetic basis of several diseases and use this information to develop treatments and preventative care. By sequencing the genomes of viruses and bacteria, one can obtain key insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases. But the acquisition, processing, and analysis of large amounts of genomic data pose several fundamental questions such as: (i) how much sequencing data need be collected to reliably learn the genome of a species? (ii) how much can one compress genomic sequencing data while maintaining its usefulness? (iii) how do sequencing errors impact the ability to perform biologically valid inference? The goal of this project is to develop a framework to establish the informational limits of genomic data science problems, that is, establish what genomic data can and cannot reveal. This will lead to the development of computationally efficient algorithms that process genomic data in an information-optimal way. The project will also mentor underrepresented students and provide them with research opportunities in the field of genomics. The research efforts will directly shape the contents of an undergraduate course on data science, which, in turn, will produce materials (lecture notes, educational videos, data assignments, open-source code) that will be used to disseminate reliable information about genomic technologies to the community. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A distinctive aspect of genomic data science is that it operates mainly on sequence data. The proposed research will be organized along three main thrusts, each one focused on a key data science task that arises when dealing with genomic sequence data: (1) aligning pairs of sequences, (2) reconstructing sequences from noisy fragments, and (3) clustering sequences based on appropriate metrics. Since the pairwise alignment of a large number of noisy sequences is often a bottleneck in genomic data science, the first thrust will study how low-dimensional representations of these sequences, or sketches, can be optimally used for alignment computation. A source-coding framework will be leveraged to study the tradeoffs between sketch size and the incurred distortion in alignment computation. The second thrust, on sequence reconstruction, will tackle the fact that computational complexity obstacles such as NP-hardness often do not appropriately capture the complexity of real-world problem instances. A notion of instance-based informational hardness is introduced to allow the development of efficient algorithms with instance-specific theoretical guarantees. Finally, the third thrust studies the problem of clustering sequences in the context of metagenomic sequencing, where the goal is to determine which sequences come from the same microbial genome. Information-theoretic metrics for the clustering of metagenomic sequencing data will be introduced and used in algorithms that seek to resolve microbial communities at the maximum resolution allowed by the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.944941997528076, \"y\": 7.440426826477051}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Network Cluster: The Coastal Critical Zone: Processes that transform landscapes and fluxes between land and sea\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Coastal marshes are essential environments that preserve a fragile and highly valuable ecosystem. They are an integral part of the Critical Zone that regulates the conditions at the Earth\\u2019s surface and helps sustain life. Coastal marshes provide crucial services such as carbon storage and removal of nutrients and contaminants that would otherwise make their way to the ocean.  Rising sea level is expanding these environments, but salt-water is also moving in, destroying woodlands, and damaging farm fields. Ghost forests and salt-damaged farm fields are stark indicators of these ecological changes along world coastlines that can adversely affect land use and economies. Less apparent, and perhaps even more important, are the concurrent changes in water and chemical cycling that are altering the functioning of the coastal Critical Zone. This research project will quantify the processes that occur in the changing coastal Critical Zone and associated alterations in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin. The project will address important questions about how sea-level rise may alter the natural \\u201cplumbing\\u201d that occurs at the land-sea boundary and its implications with respect to coastal ecosystems. The results will assist decision-makers and stakeholders in planning for future environmental changes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will quantify the coupled processes and feedbacks that govern the hydrological, ecological, geomorphological, and biogeochemical transformations in the coastal Critical Zone and how rising sea level will translate to changes in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin. Sea-level rise pushes salt and inundation fronts inland via storms and tides (fast processes) while gradually elevating the water table (slow processes). The complexity of the system, with its strong hydrologic transience (e.g. tides, storms), tightly coupled ecosystem and biogeochemical mosaics, and human influences, make functioning and response at the marsh-upland transition difficult to characterize and predict. The governing hypotheses of this project address (1) the major fast and slow hydrological drivers of coastal Critical-Zone transition, (2) the landscape feedbacks in which ecological change drives geomorphological evolution that feeds back into hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and (3) biogeochemical feedbacks in which salinization and redox shifts alter cycling, mobility, and sequestration of nutrients and carbon. These processes differ between areas where the marsh abuts forested uplands versus agricultural land. The hypotheses will be addressed through interdisciplinary field observations, experiments, and modeling that are fully integrated across three locations along the mid-Atlantic coast with paired marsh-forest and marsh-agriculture sites. The forested and agricultural sites at each location represent major differences in hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology, and are expected to respond differently to rising sea level.

Antimicrobials delivered in this fashion reach minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC); however, the primary culprit causing persistent PJI is often bacterial biofilm. The ability to adequately treat and eradicate biofilm-related infections requires an antibiotic concentration known as the minimum bacterial eradication concentration (MBEC), which is 100-1000 times greater in concentration than the MIC.

By considering the way militarized social and economic spaces provide possibilities for certain forms of work and social relationships to be pursued, this project not only provides a novel approach to the study of security, but also contributes to social scientific studies of political economy and gender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 2.21341872215271, \"y\": 7.1588287353515625}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Variational Methods for the Analysis of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Unsupervised learning can be described as the task of finding structure from unlabeled observations. This is a fundamental task in scientific fields like biology, material science, economics, and astronomy, where in a typical scenario researchers possess a large number of unlabeled data, but only a few (or none) expert labeled data points, as these are typically very expensive to obtain. This project focuses on the mathematical analysis of data science algorithms for unsupervised learning. Broadly speaking, the aim of the investigation is to contribute to the development of mathematical foundations for data science and artificial intelligence by providing rigorous mathematical theory supporting methodologies used in practice, as well as by proposing principled novel ones. The investigator will not only study individual algorithms, but find common structure between them and highlight their otherwise unclear unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the many methodologies for unsupervised learning found in the literature, graph-based methods occupy a prominent role, and they will be the focus of this investigation. These are algorithms that rely on having access to similarity graphs, which endow data sets with a geometric structure. Different graphs capture different features of a given data set and hence are useful for different tasks. The project will focus on the following concrete directions: 1) the proposal and analysis of new algorithms for unsupervised learning inspired by variational methods for evolution on metric spaces and in particular on the space of probability measures over discrete and semi-discrete structures. In this direction the main goal is to introduce a mathematical formalism for the design of new learning methodologies, and to use this formalism in order to build connections between seemingly unrelated statistical procedures like those inspired by mode-seeking techniques as the ones based on spectral methods. Some of the applications in mind go beyond unsupervised learning, and also include the systematic testing of deep neural network architectures. The second direction concerns the study of statistical properties of graph-based unsupervised learning algorithms in settings where graphs capturing the geometry of a data set are very sparse (below standard connectivity), or where data generating distributions are degenerate and violate standard geometric assumptions found in the literature. In this direction, the goal is to identify the limits of sparsity that allow for meaningful learning, as well as to develop quantitative statistical error analysis for solutions to non-convex optimization problems on graphs built on data sets, for graphs that are connected to a ground truth geometric model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.696401119232178, \"y\": 9.30777359008789}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"GOALI: Dynamics of Ultrasound-Responsive Polymeric Systems: from Atoms to Devices\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Shape memory polymers are an emerging class of smart materials that have the ability to return from a deformed temporary shape to their original permanent shape when subjected to an external stimulus such as heat, light, and a magnetic field.

In many of these applications, there is an immediate industrial need for replacing conventional triggering methods for actuating the polymers with a more efficient and flexible method. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant will investigate high-intensity focused ultrasound as a novel and promising stimulus with unique capabilities to actuate the controlled shape recovery of shape memory polymers. Focused ultrasound actuates the polymer remotely and locally, is noninvasive, and is biocompatible. These properties make the methodology a superior candidate, particularly for biomedical applications. The research will be integrated into industrial practice by the industrial partner, MedShape Inc., to provide practical approaches for the fabrication of ultrasound-sensitive polymers for medical applications.

CD can efficiently and rapidly sterilize various PPEs to help resolve the massive shortage problem upon an outbreaks of public health emergencies, and offers an efficient sterilization solution for shared surfaces, confined space, and possibly open air to prevent COVID-19 spread. This would drastically mitigate the PPE shortage at hospitals, and allow citizens\\u2019 access to masks, which will help to flatten the curve of SARS-CoV-2 infection and support economic recovery.

The overarching aim of this work is to better understand how light availability, plant architecture, and leaf surface temperature interact to determine the efficiency of plant systems with respect to input resources. In order to examine such processes, novel experimental and analytical techniques will be used that allow for measurement and prediction of interactions between plant structure and function in three dimensions.

A complete mechanistic theoretical basis that describes how plants simultaneously control stomatal aperture, canopy architecture, and physiological parameters in order to maximize carbon gain with respect to water loss has remained elusive, and represents a significant knowledge gap that has inhibited efforts to quantitatively describe plant responses to drought stress, and ultimately to predict plant responses to future climate scenarios characterized by elevated temperatures and precipitation variability. This project proposes to advance research and education in plant water-use efficiency by fusing novel experimental, modeling, and visualization techniques to better understand the roles of simultaneous variation in light, temperature, and canopy architecture in optimization of gas exchange by plants across spatial and temporal scales.

Seawater desalination is a drought-proof technology that can address growing demands for water in agriculture and other uses. At present, seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) is the best available commercially available desalination technology. However, the desalinated seawater cannot be used directly in irrigation due to the limited ability to remove boron. This results from limitations on the boron retention capability of commercial SWRO membranes. Boron adversely impacts plant growth and damages apple, citrus, grapes, and other crops when water containing more than 0.3 mg/L of boron is used in irrigation. Thus, commercial SWRO plants must use an additional purification step to reduce boron concentration to acceptable concentrations. This greatly increases the energy consumption and costs of using desalinated water for agriculture. The proposed research will address the inefficiencies associated with boron removal through the development of a novel selective separation technology based on electrosorption. This new technology will be chemical-free, energy efficient, and capable of recovering a high purity boron stream for beneficial uses. Successful completion of this project will advance the development of the next generation of sustainable SWRO plants, with great potential benefit to society. The project will fruther benefit society by providing research training to graduate and undergraduate students at Yale University. Also, the investigator will promote diversity and enhance the involvement of under-represented groups in science and engineering through engagement in Yale's K-12 outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critical and unresolved challenge in SWRO desalination is to produce a permeate water stream suitable for irrigation without additional and costly purification to remove plant-toxic elements such as boron. The overall goal of this project is to develop an innovative flow-through electrosorption process for boron removal and recovery in seawater desalination. To achieve this goal, the PI proposes to carry out an integrated experimental and modeling project structured around the following tasks: 1) fabrication of an ultra-selective positive electrode (anode) using boron-chelating resins as building blocks; 2) performance testing of the fabricated electrodes for selective boron removal and recovery; 3) elucidation of the mechanisms underlying selective boron electrosorption; 4) assessment of the impact of electrochemical reactions on the long-term stability and boron selectivity of the electrodes; and 5) evaluation and modeling of the energy consumption and boron selectivity of the combined SWRO-electrosorption process.

This multiscale framework will also be used to build a database of synthesis-morphology conditions to guide the design of new 2D materials. The developed synthesis-morphology database will be used in combination with the ML models, specifically Generative adversarial networks, to predict the morphology and properties of 2D materials significantly faster than the multiscale model.

Tensor decomposition, a class of multi-aspect data analytic methods, has been empirically shown to be particularly effective in such integration in a number of diverse applications, including: chemometrics, signal processing, social network analysis, and brain data analysis. Despite their effectiveness, current tensor methods have a crucial limitation that hinders their broad applicability: conducting tensor analysis is largely a manual endeavor that entails laborious trial-and-error tuning and requires both high familiarity with tensor methods and domain expertise in the target application. As a result, the number of practitioners who can successfully apply tensor analysis is limited and, thus, tensor analysis has not enjoyed as broad an adoption despite being such a powerful tool.

The project will learn infection prediction models for COVID-19 considering the following. (i) Predicting at state/county/city-level rather than country-level as finer granularity is essential in planning and managing resources. (ii) How infectious a person is changes over time.

Due to the ability to capture temporal heterogeneity in infection rate, the approach has the potential to provide insights into infectious nature of COVID-19 which are not fully understood yet. The project will address the issue of unreported cases through temporal analysis of historical infections and correct the data. The right granularities of modeling will be automatically identified, e.g., when to model a state over its cities to trade-off precision for higher reliability in predictions. The proposed project also formulates and solves a resource allocation problem that can guide the response to contain the epidemic and prevent future outbreaks. This is provided by optimal solutions to resource allocation over a network where each node (representing a region) has a function that captures probabilistic response. While the project obtains data with COVID-19 in consideration, the model and algorithms developed under the project are applicable to a wide class of contagious diseases.

These skills are increasingly needed in STEM disciplines. As young people learn to code, they engage in computational thinking concepts and practices which are problem solving strategies that include repeated process (iterative) design skills. This project promotes innovation by designing and developing activities for tinkering spaces (a space filled with materials for hands-on exploration of STEM) combined with coding in informal learning organizations such as museums, and community centers.  The project supports both tinkering and making as methods to meaningfully incorporate computational thinking in STEM learning experiences.  The tinkering approach to learning is characterized by hands-on, trial and error engagement. Making is similar to tinkering with additional attention to learning with peer groups. The long-term goal of the project is to enable informal educators to engage in STEM programming with youth and families from underrepresented groups. The project brings together interdisciplinary teams from the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), the Tinkering Studio at the Exploratorium, and the Lifelong Kindergarten research group at the Massachusetts Institution of Technology. In collaboration with local partner sites, the project team will design and disseminate a collection of six computational tinkering activity areas that engage learners in creative explorations using a combination of physical objects and computational code. The team will develop visual coding \\\"microworlds\\\" for each of the activity areas, specialized sets of coding blocks designed to provide scaffolding. Additionally, the project team will design and develop facilitation guides to document these activities and facilitation strategies, as well as workshops to better support facilitators in making and tinkering spaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project enhances knowledge building through investigations of what instructional supports informal educators need to develop effective facilitation practices that engage underrepresented youth and families in STEM computational learning experiences. Study participants will include informal educators in museum, library, and community-based settings with varying backgrounds and experiences facilitating computing activities. The project team will also engage youth and families from underrepresented groups through collaborative efforts with community-based partners. Research questions include: 1) What challenges and barriers do informal learning educator, face to engage their learners in design-based activities with computing? 2) What supports informal learning educators to take on key facilitation practices that support children and families in computational tinkering activities? 3) In jointly engaging in these computational tinkering activities, how do the activities and informal learning educators\\u2019 facilitation of these activities impact children\\u2019s and families\\u2019 development of computational tinkering and identities as creators and learners with computing? To answer these research questions the project will use qualitative ethnographic methods to study the developing interactions between learners and facilitators at three local sites.

The field of spintronics aims to harness the electron spin to connect different physics fields of electricity, magnetism, and optics, etc. One of the first applications of spintronics was in the hard disk drive read head, which significantly increased storage density, accelerating the development of computers and the internet. In recent years, new developments in spintronics have led to a plethora of novel applications, such as magnetic random access memories that are fast and non-volatile, and Terahertz pulse generators that are powerful and economic. These applications are all based on the interactions between electric currents and electron spins. This CAREER project aims to develop and understand new interactions between electric currents and electron spins by using novel materials/structures with broken symmetries. Compared to traditional spintronics devices, the use of symmetry-broken systems will unlock new functionalities. Success in this proposed research will expedite the development of next-generation non-volatile memory and logic devices with enhanced energy efficiency and inspire development of new spintronics devices such as light helicity and surface magnetization detectors. The teaching and outreach activities include by leveraging the proposed research, the PI will design undergraduate and graduate course modules that integrate hands-on experiments in magnetism by using lab tools as well as smartphone applications. The PI will continue to host online spintronics seminars and online tutorials, which will serve as a platform for educating and attracting young scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driven by the spin-orbit interaction, the interconversion between electric current and spin current in conventional nonmagnetic materials generally follows the spin Hall symmetry, such that the electric current, spin current and spin orientation are all orthogonal to each other. This symmetry restriction makes it challenging to generate out-of-plane polarized spin current in thin film devices, which is highly desired in practical magnetic memory applications. This CAREER project explores interconversions between electric current and spin current with new symmetries in symmetry-broken systems. The two main categories of symmetry-broken systems to be explored are (1) magnetically-ordered heterostructures and (2) nonmagnetic films with microstructural asymmetry. The symmetry and efficiency of spin current generation will be detected by measuring spin-orbit torque exerted onto a neighboring magnetic layer via complementary optical and electrical techniques. This measurement will serve as a guideline to select and optimize the most efficient systems to generate out-of-plane polarized spin current. Using the optimized system, current-induced damping modulation and field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization will be experimentally studied.  In addition, new phenomena based on the spin-charge conversion with unconventional symmetry will also be experimentally explored in optical spin pumping and spin Hall magnetoresistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.316218376159668, \"y\": 8.418519973754883}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"EAGER: SARE: Collaborative: Low Energy Secure Wireless Transceiversfor IoT Trusted Communications\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Low-energy wireless communication is gaining currency as the preferred method to maintain connectivity between users in a network. Establishing the security and trust in the wireless communication link is vital to maintaining the security and privacy of users. Existing solutions to create a secure and trustworthy data communication link have primarily focused on complicated energy-intensive digital encoding performed in the backend. While effective, this approach is inherently inconsistent with the low-energy nature of the wireless link. This project aims to address this challenge by developing low-energy radio frequency (RF) and analog security features that can be implemented in the RF front-end. The new knowledge gained from this research will form the foundation for low-power low-latency trusted wireless communications. Besides consumer electronics, the successful development of low-energy secure radio transceivers will have profound impact on various applications and industries, where secure and trusted access to the electromagnetic spectrum is paramount. In addition to the technical impact, the project broadly benefits the society. By bringing much-needed low-cost security to low-energy devices connected through the internet of things (IoT), this research will have a far-reaching positive impact in enhancing the lives and privacy of people from disadvantageous social economic groups who increasingly use these devices in their daily life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to create a new framework for low-energy low-latency secure and trustworthy wireless communication transceivers by employing security features in the RF and analog domain that obviate the need for energy-hungry real-time digital backend encryption.

By obfuscating the modulated waveform in the analog domain, a secure wireless link is envisaged. Once a secure wireless link/channel is established, device authentication is applied in the analog domain using unique device attributes.

Over the last century, scientists have intensely investigated macro- and microscopic systems composed of plasmas. Optical investigations of laboratory scale plasmas have been dominated by several well-known techniques for some time, and stagnation in development of new techniques has critically limited information accessible to measurements that use light as a probe. Recently, new and transformative microscopes that make images with assistance from powerful computer algorithms have led to an ever-increasing amount of information extracted from physical systems, even for the same amount of collected data. With these advances, it is now possible to image the thickness or height of objects, and their material composition all in three-dimensions using a single, short burst of light. This project will enable application of the new computational microscopy techniques to the study of microplasmas.

However, this information is qualitative in nature.  Interferometric imaging requires a known reference, relatively small phase shifts, and is quite sensitive to vibrations; it also requires careful timing between the reference wave and the interrogating wave and is therefore more experimentally complicated. Shadowgraphy is the simplest experimental configuration but is the most complicated method to analyze; and while Zernike phase contrast imaging is an excellent technique, it is not capable of producing reference free images with simultaneous phase and amplitude. Only coherent computational imaging is capable of producing quantitative, single-shot, reference free images with simultaneous phase and amplitude contrast -- over a range of frequencies, in three-dimensions.

Networks are very convenient for describing relationship between nodes that may represent people in a social network  or brain regions of a person. One of the properties of the majority of networks is that they can be divided into communities with distinct properties and connection patterns. These partitions can be used for answering a variety of questions such as finding tightly connected social groups, or identifying brain regions' connection patterns associated with a disease. While initial efforts were focused on analysis of a single network model, in the last few years one of the most important directions in network science has shifted to the study of sets of individual networks, the so-called multilayer networks, due to both the versatility of the multilayer networks and the variety of applications that can be addressed using this concept. The objective of this research is to develop tools for theoretical and algorithmic analysis of such networks. The theories developed can be applied to analysis of speech-related brain networks that can be affected by epilepsy surgery. This research will be carried out in collaboration with the Functional Brain Mapping and Brain Computer Interface Lab of Advent Health Hospital for Children. The techniques resulting from this project could be applied in a variety of fields that rely on analysis of multilayer stochastic network data: a) medical practice, since a better understanding of connections between brain regions associated with speech will result in more safe and efficient epileptic treatment options; b) medical research, by providing tools for taking into account individual variations of connections between brain regions associated with particular diseases; c) brain science research, by providing tools for analysis of brain networks and their variations; d) molecular biology, by proposing techniques for analyzing the enzymatic influences between proteins related to various functions; e) statistical genetics, by developing procedures  for simultaneous studies of gene networks related to several diseases; f) international relations and finance, by analyzing world trade and financial networks corresponding to various modalities; g) social sciences, by analyzing the similarities and the differences in communities related to various types of social connections.

The spark of the interest in multilayer networks has led to a stream of publications on the subject. However, these publications fall into two very distinct categories: applications driven papers with no theoretical guarantees of the results and statistical papers where those guarantees are provided, but under very restrictive assumptions. While in many applications the main goal is to determine the differences between communities in different layers or sets of layers, the statistical papers focus entirely on the case where the communities are the same in all layers. Due to the absence of relevant theoretical results, in applications, the authors either utilize ad hoc techniques or are forced to make a questionable assumption that the community structure is the same for all the layers. For this reason, there is an overwhelming need for laying solid theoretical foundations and developing efficient computational algorithms for analysis of multilayer networks with diverse community structures. In particular, the objective of this research is the construction of non-parametric techniques that carry out estimation and clustering of multilayer networks where each layer follows the popular Stochastic Block Model and the community structures coincide for some layers and differ for the others. Furthermore, statistical procedures will be supplemented with the precision guarantees via oracle inequalities and minimax studies. This will be accomplished by application of modern algebraic techniques recently employed by the PI. In summary, the research will significantly broaden the arsenal of methods applicable to analysis of multilayer network data by developing techniques for non-parametric estimation and clustering that require few assumptions, are computationally viable, and are also accompanied by theoretical precision guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.002882957458496, \"y\": 8.490190505981445}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"SaTC: CORE: Small: Optimal Coin-flipping Protocols\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Achieving optimal robustness against adversarial behavior using minimum resources is central to all information sciences.

Recent feed trials have determined that a special red tropical seaweed can help reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminants by over 98%.

Yet, when they act together as a network, they result in robust brain function and precise behavioral outcomes. The advent of large-scale neural recording technologies, such as two-photon calcium imaging, has created a paradigm shift by enabling scientists and engineers to study the activity of large populations of neurons in order to decipher how they collectively encode information from the external world and distill them to elicit robust behavior. In order to fully utilize these data, computationally efficient and mathematically principled techniques for robust network-level inference are required. The research objective of this proposal is to develop such methodologies to infer network-level characteristics of ensemble neuronal activity from two-photon imaging data, and to apply these methods to large-scale recordings in order to reveal the computational principles that underlie sensory processing and behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research approaches include: developing a robust framework for joint inference of the intrinsic and stimulus-driven correlations of neuronal activity, designing a functional taxonomy to characterize the relevance of neuronal activity to sensory processing and behavioral outcomes, and constructing an estimation framework for capturing the dynamics and functional relevance of higher-order synchronous neuronal activity. This project addresses several outstanding challenges faced by existing methodologies, including biased network characterization incurred by two-stage analysis pipelines, intermixing the contributions of exogenous and endogenous processes to collective neuronal activity, and studying sensory processing and behavioral elicitation as disjoint problems. By employing two-photon calcium imaging data from mice and zebrafish, the proposed modeling and estimation framework will be used to investigate several fundamental problems in systems neuroscience such as tonotopic diversity in the auditory cortex, interaction of sensory processing and decision-making, and visuo-motor coordination.

But testing misses bugs, so costly and harmful bugs often occur in deployed software. Techniques that can help find more bugs during testing are needed. Runtime verification is one such technique; it finds bugs by checking program runs against formal specifications that describe correct program behavior. This project seeks to make runtime verification more effective and more efficient. The project also aims to facilitate teaching runtime verification to software engineers by creating a course on runtime verification, integrating runtime-verification modules into a software-testing course, and creating publicly available pedagogical materials and open-source tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on addressing four major impediments to runtime-verification usage: (1) most signaled violations are false alarms, because existing specifications are inadequate; (2) confirming whether a signaled violation is a bug takes too much developer time; (3) runtime verification does not scale to the large software systems on which society increasingly depends; and (4) it is expensive for developers to write tests that cover code where specifications may be violated. Automated solutions to address these impediments will require fundamental advances in operations on traces -- sequences of program events -- that are generated during runtime verification. Consequently, this project will develop a trace-aware runtime-verification technique that works directly on traces. Automated techniques based on trace-aware runtime verification will also be developed to (1) reduce false alarms by repairing existing specifications; (2) classify each violation as a likely bug or false alarm; (3) reduce redundant computations performed during runtime verification; and (4) generate tests automatically to adequately check code with respect to the specifications.

The proposed tunable, mid-infrared source has many advantages over existing coherent infrared sources such as tunable lasers which include complete mechanical motion free tunability of wavelength, small size for various lightweight and mobile platforms, and extremely fast response for high speed applications. The small form factor, tunability and integration potential of these devices will usher a new generation of optical lab-on-chip devices where detection of relevant biomarkers, cells, and ligand chemistries can be spectroscopically realized and thus will enable the development of inexpensive, next generation point of care biosensors. The availability of frequency tunable emitters is likely to open opportunities in the area of on-chip optical communications and optical data transfer that are hitherto considered as cumbersome. The potential bandwidth afforded by such systems may revolutionize data transfer rates and volumes. A robust research and mentoring program consisting of a graduate and undergraduate student working on the project is proposed for this 1-year EAGER proposal.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to explore, investigate, and demonstrate the possibility of achieving tunable, coherent radiation sources in 11 - 12 \\u03bcm wavelength range. To accomplish this, we propose to hybridize the localized surface resonance of bulk thermo-plasmonic materials such as silicon carbide with gate-tunable surface plasmonic resonance of two-dimensional materials such as graphene to manipulate the emission characteristics of thermal radiation sources. The proposed experimental study will examine the relation between applied gate-voltage modulated optical properties of graphene, and the corresponding shift in coupled plasmonic and phononic resonance. The study is aimed at deepening the understanding of the coupling between surface phonon resonances of a radiating surface and gate tunable surface plasmon resonance of graphene sheets. The fact that surface phonons and surface plasmons are consequences of resonant ions and electrons respectively raises interesting questions of how momentum matching is balanced between particles of different rest masses. This study will present details of theoretical and the experimentally obtained emission/absorption properties at different temperatures and different wavelengths, specifically, the minimum resolution of wavelength shift that can be achieved with gate-voltage and temperature. From an experimental standpoint, the proposed work will systematically investigate plasmonic tuning of the emission characteristics. Heterogeneous integration techniques with novel micro and nanofabrication methods will be used. The electronic control will allow for programmability of the emitter to auto-sweep through a band of wavelength of interest, to determine the absorption spectrum of samples in spectroscopy applications. The wavelength sweep timeframes of the spectrometers can be potentially accomplished in the milli \\u2013 nano seconds allowing for the realization of ultrafast IR tunable sources.

Some basic laws governing turbulence were established by Andrei Kolmogorov in his now-famous series of theoretical works published in the 1940s (collectively known as K41 theory). Although highly influential, this theory is not complete: even though some predictions of K41 are remarkably accurate, some are not, pointing to problems in the assumptions underpinning K41. These defects (often referred to as \\\"intermittency\\\") are an active subject of study in the physics and engineering communities. Moreover, K41 theory was derived based on empirical observations regarding how turbulent fluids behave. It remains a grand challenge to substantiate any of the K41 predictions directly from the fundamental equations (the Navier-Stokes equations) governing how fluids evolve in time. The far-reaching goal of this project is to address these shortcomings by providing a mathematically rigorous theory that bridges the gap between the fundamental equations governing fluids and the most accurate of the K41 predictions. This will be done by importing and improving on recent advances in random dynamical systems theory. Providing such a mathematical bridge could also potentially shed light on less well-understood aspects of turbulence theory, such as intermittency. The PI will train graduate students specializing in dynamical systems in preparation for this cross-disciplinary research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the aim of this work is to develop mathematical tools with the long-term goal of obtaining a mathematical proof, directly from the Navier-Stokes equations, of the following two empirically observed properties of turbulent fluids: (a) sensitivity with respect to initial conditions (i.e., a positive Lyapunov exponent) and (b) weak anomalous dissipation (i.e., energy in the fluid is dissipated at a constant positive rate even as viscosity is taken to 0 with all other parameters of the fluid experiment held constant). Properties (a) and (b) are interrelated but not exactly the same: property (a) has to do with the separation of nearby trajectories in phase space, while (b) has to do with the so-called energy cascade, a nonlinear \\\"conveyor-belt\\\"-type effect which transmits kinetic energy in the fluid from low to high Fourier modes until dissipation effects due to viscosity take over. However, progress on one could lead to a better understanding of the other, e.g., property (b) is likely related to the presence of a high-dimensional chaotic SRB attractor for the Navier-Stokes equations, which is only possible if property (a) is true. Towards goal (a), a major mathematical challenge is that it is typically intractably hard to prove that a given dynamical system is chaotic\\u2014 this is true even for two-dimensional toy models such as the Chirikov-Taylor standard map, which features fundamental coexistence of ordered elliptic-type and chaotic behavior. On the other hand, advances by the PI and others have made considerable progress towards verifying chaotic behavior for systems subjected to stochastic driving, as is typically assumed in models relevant to turbulence. The work in this proposal will extend and enhance these theoretical tools with the ultimate aim of establishing property (a) for realistic fluids models such as the GOY and SABRA shell models as well as for the hyperviscous 3D Navier-Stokes equations in the limit as Reynolds number is taken to infinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.399914264678955, \"y\": 9.057788848876953}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Drivers and consequences of intermarriage on social networks and risk-buffering\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Boundaries between groups break down when couples marry across different cultural, ethnic and/or religious affiliations.

This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field of AI and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage. The DMC creates the opportunity to bring in participants who might not have attended an AI conference due to lack of resources. This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender collaborations across the breadth of disciplines.

Because it is readily scalable, FSP has significant applications in powder production for photocatalysts, gas sensors, batteries, solar cells, and fuel cells. While the production of metal oxide nanocrystalline materials has been demonstrated using FSP, it is currently unknown how to control the process to make the chemically pure materials needed for the applications described. Because purely experimental approaches to optimizing the FPS are costly and time-intensive, a new modeling framework for FSP reactors will be developed in this research program to predict how powder particles form and grow in flame reactors. To describe this complex process, the model must integrate elements corresponding to the decomposition chemistry of metal-containing feed components, fuel pyrolysis and oxidation, and aerosol particle nucleation and growth dynamics. The outcome of this combined modeling and experimental program will be a computational tool that can predict the chemical composition, size distribution, and crystal phase of the nanocrystals as the numerous FSP processing parameters are changed. From a fundamental perspective, this project will promote progress in aerosol science and advance the field of chemical reaction engineering. From the application viewpoint, this project will enable computer-based design of FSP reactors capable of high-precision control and significantly reduced fuel costs for nanoparticle manufacturing operations. From an educational perspective, the research team will incorporate the outcomes of this project into their course content, help train the next generation STEM workforce, and continue to include more undergraduates and diversified/under-represented groups into frontier research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By leveraging their past success in spray combustion and soot/aerosol modeling, the research team proposes a new modeling framework, with supporting experimental measurements, that will enable model-based design and optimization of FSP reactors for perovskite oxide synthesis. The research project will focus on the synthesis of Lanthanum doped Barium Titanate (La:BaTiO3) by FSP using ethylhexanoate-derived metal precursors and ethylhexanoic acid as a fuel. Experiments to measure the atomic percentages of La, Ba, Ti, and O in mobility-size selected nanocrystals, and the percentages of BaTiO3, BaO, and TiO2 (along with phase information) in the synthesis of La:BaTiO3, will be used to provide validation data for the proposed model. Detailed chemical reaction mechanisms for precursor decomposition, fuel oxidation and pyrolysis, nanoparticle nucleation and surface reactions for multiple metal salt precursors will be identified using a global reaction pathway selection analysis tool developed by the project team. Likewise, a dynamic adaptive chemistry technique will be used as a model reduction method enabling simulations of complex reaction systems using practical levels of computational resources. Finally, a 7-dimensional hybrid sectional-moment model will be developed to track the fractions of BaO, TiO2, and BaTiO3, particle size, and crystallite size specifically to answer whether the nanoparticle composition changes during growth. When complete, the modeling strategy will be broadly applicable to flame pyrolysis systems for a wide range of industrial-scale particle manufacturing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.374354362487793, \"y\": 7.683304309844971}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology FY 2020: Going back in time: using museum collections to reconstruct the history of a host shift in an invasive insect\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Interactions between insects and the plants they eat impacts biodiversity, and the introduction of a non-native species provides a unique window into the earliest stages of how these introduced insects adapt to a new food source. This research uses a wealth of historical data in museum collections to reconstruct how an invasive insect pest adapted to a native host plant over a 100-year period. By integrating fieldwork, laboratory work, and genomic data from historical and current samples, the fellow will gain insight into how invasive species adapt over time and in different environments. Better knowledge of how invasive species change to fit their new surroundings is vital for understanding evolution, as well as developing strategies for agricultural pest management. This research will also provide training for the fellow to use and contribute to undervalued museum collections, mentor individuals from underrepresented groups in field research, and create a website for public engagement in pest identification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellow will investigate the morphological, behavioral, and genetic changes that accompanied adaptation to a native pine in the invasive pine sawfly Diprion similis. First introduced to North America in 1914, D. similis rapidly shifted to native White Pine, Pinus strobus. To reconstruct the history of this host shift, the fellow will combine extensive museum collections of D. similis from 3 international institutions together with sampling from contemporary populations. First, the fellow will use museum specimens and associated host data to assess morphological and behavioral change across both the native and introduced ranges over the entire history of the invasion. Second, the fellow will evaluate whether these morphological and behavioral changes are adaptive by revisiting historical collection sites and using a combination of field surveys and laboratory assays to measure host preference and host performance. Finally, the project aims to use whole-genome resequencing data from both modern and historical samples to uncover the demographic history of the North American invasion. Together, this project aims to address several longstanding questions about host specialization and rapid adaptation in invasive species, while meeting several career training goals. The fellow will become an expert in working with D. similis, as well as develop genomic skills and resources to enable use of this novel study system in an independent research position.

Unfortunately, the difficulty in writing models correctly remains a barrier to their adoption for large, complex software designs. This project develops the Alloy Analyzer Plus, an integrated development environment (IDE) toolset, that will provide a one-stop shop for software testing methods and enables the development of correct models written in the Alloy modeling language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project will create the Alloy Analyzer Plus IDE by building out two important infrastructure thrusts:  first, the creation of workflows for verification techniques of Alloy models, enabling systematic unit testing, mutation testing and fault localization; and second, the creation of workflows for synthesis techniques of Alloy models, enabling correct from construction models through repair and sketching. These two thrusts will culminate in the creation of a guided development environment that can iteratively walk users through building correct models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project bridges the gap between imperative IDEs and declarative-modeling IDEs. A robust verification-oriented IDE reduces the learning curve for Alloy and facilitates a larger adoption of software modeling. Furthermore, by enabling more reliable Alloy models, this project in turn leads to the development of more reliable software systems. The project will also help enhance formal methods curricula, as the Alloy Analyzer Plus synthesis capabilities provide an interactive tool to teach first-order logic. The project will extensively involve graduate students, notably those from underrepresented minorities, and expose them to formal methods and tool development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main code base will be maintained for a minimum of three years on GitHub under the Apache License 2.0.

They are formed when matter collapses in on itself under the force of gravity, producing a singularity of infinite density.  This singularity cannot be directly observed because it is surrounded by an event horizon, the point where the black hole\\u2019s gravitational field is so strong that even light cannot escape, but matter outside the event horizon can in principle be observed.  On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) succeeded in producing the first image of a black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, 55 million light years from Earth.  The observed ring of light bent in the immense gravity was stunning confirmation that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of galaxies. The EHT results enabled scientists to verify key predictions of Einstein\\u2019s theory of gravity at the black hole boundary and to study how supermassive black holes dominate the energetics and dynamics at the centers of galaxies.  This project aims to build upon this success by improving the EHT so that astronomers can make black hole images that are much more detailed and take the first steps towards making black hole movies.  Observations under this award will address key questions about general relativity and astronomy, including whether black holes spin and how they launch powerful jets that travel at nearly the speed of light to distances larger than the host galaxy itself.  This project includes resources for training the next generation of radio astronomers involving postdoctoral scholars and graduate and undergraduate students at US universities, including minority-serving institutions, and will undertake cultural outreach to the Hawaiian community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports continued operations of an enhanced Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) over the next three years to test general relativity and study the astrophysics of supermassive black holes, including the Galactic Center source (Sagittarius A*) and the black hole in the center of the nearby galaxy M87.  Investments in instrumentation to transform submillimeter VLBI into a standard observing mode across the heterogeneous array will enable monitoring campaigns triggered during optimal observing conditions, allowing a study of the dynamics of the material at the base of the jet in M87.  The extension of observing to the 345 GHz frequency band will increase the angular resolution of the EHT, sharpen its view of Sagittarius A* due to reduced interstellar scattering, enhance its ability to study the structure of the magnetic field in these and other sources,  and test the prediction that photon rings are independent of observing frequency.  The EHT will continue to be made available to the broader astronomical community through an annual call for proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.376122951507568, \"y\": 8.837434768676758}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"SBIR Phase I:  Development of a rapid, point-of-care coagulation test for the investigation and treatment of COVID-19-related coagulopathy.\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a rapid, point-of-care device that allows for the precision management of blood clotting (coagulation) disorders and therapies.

The event will take place in conjunction with (and on the first day of) the Eleventh International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams (DIAGRAMS 2020), to be held August 24-28, 2020, at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia, and which will be co-located with the International Workshop on Set Visualization and Reasoning 2020.  Diagrams are wide-ranging and open-ended representations that include sketches, drawings, charts, pictures, 2D and 3D geometric models, and maps. They are a vital tool in human communication in areas such as art and science, as well as commerce and industry. A better understanding of how effective diagrams can be generated and used has the potential to produce transformative advances in these areas. DIAGRAMS is the only conference series that provides a forum for all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams. It is a bi-annual, international and interdisciplinary event whose goals are to present and discuss (a) state-of-the-art research on computational, cognitive and socio-cultural theories, models and techniques of reasoning with diagrammatic representations, and (b) cutting-edge intelligent and interactive information technologies for using diagrammatic representations in supporting human reasoning. Research topics include understanding diagrammatic reasoning in humans, understanding the use of diagrammatic representation for communication, developing techniques for automated diagrammatic reasoning, and designing tools for use of diagrammatic representations. The conference series is overseen by the DIAGRAMS Steering Committee with a rotating membership; more information is available at the conference website http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2020/.  DIAGRAMS 2020 will significantly increase our understanding of diagrammatic reasoning in humans and machines, and will add momentum to the development of new information technologies for the use of diagrammatic representations in support of human reasoning. The conference will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and by catalyzing new collaborations. The Doctoral Symposium will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and help train them by providing early input from senior researchers in the field in an interactive and constructive environment. The social network among this next generation of researchers, and the relationships with senior researchers, created by the workshop will play a critical role in their enculturation into the profession. Diversity of the selected students is a goal of the organizers, who will be proactive to ensure that both students and faculty are a diverse group across multiple dimensions including nationality, scientific discipline and gender. To further assure diversity, only one student will be selected from each educational institution, with preference given to students from underrepresented populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the DIAGRAMS 2020 Doctoral Symposium is to increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas. The workshop will be a research-focused day-long meeting that affords participants an opportunity to present their work and get feedback from established researchers in the field, who will be present to comment on the young researchers' presentations in an informal and constructive environment. Each invited participant will have approximately half an hour for presentation of their research, that may include a short demonstration if appropriate, and which will be followed by discussion and critiquing. For some students, this may be their first opportunity to give a research talk outside their home institutions.  Therefore, each student will be assigned a mentor (selected from the Program Committee), who will preview the student's presentation and offer suggestions for improvement as well as provide sample questions that may arise during the discussion.

An L-function is a special kind of function that packages together information about an arithmetical object that arises from studying it modulo p for each prime p. For instance, the Riemann zeta function is the simplest example of an L-function and has proven to be indispensable in studying the distribution of the prime numbers.  Other types of L-functions are crucial for understanding if certain polynomial equations have solutions, or more generally, how many solutions there are. Often these questions are related to how large the L-function is at a special point.  Much of this project concerns the development of new tools for studying how L-functions may fit into families and using these tools to better understand individual L-functions. The investigator will continue to advise PhD students and to mentor and collaborate with undergraduate students, especially through the Texas A&amp;M Research Experience for Undergraduates.  This type of mentorship is invaluable in preparing students for graduate studies, particularly for undergraduate students from non-PhD granting institutions as well as from population groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study new families of L-functions and use them as tools for estimating L-functions on the critical line.

As a field, EER benefits from diverse perspectives aimed at improving engineering education and challenging existing models of professional formation of engineers, but there is a need to formalize how scholars hone their own research and communication skills through reviewing. We propose the EER Peer Review Training (EER PERT) program, leveraging the knowledge and organizational structure developed in the Journal of Engineering Education (JEE) Mentored Reviewer Program in which triads of mentees and mentors (experienced reviewers) collaboratively write timely, constructive reviews of JEE manuscripts. EER PERT participants include mentees, mentors, and mentor coaches. Diverse participants will be selected through a competitive application process and recruitment through personal and professional networks, including HBCU and MSI networks. Coaches will monitor the quality of the mentoring relationships within mentor/mentee triads through periodic surveys and meetings, and will provide feedback to the project team. In parallel with developing and implementing this training, we will study how reviewers develop mental models of EER. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ongoing studies about the peer review process have identified problems including lack of reviewer training, inconsistent and biased reviews, and dearth of qualified reviewers. Poor quality peer reviews can lead to poor quality scholarship; overly harsh, negative reviews can exclude diverse voices in the community and stifle innovation. We will leverage a training framework developed through the JEE Mentored Reviewer Program, in which participants have described positive outcomes of expanded expertise, a greater understanding of research quality, and shifting the dominant (negative) discourses about peer review to a more positive view of knowledge production and publishing. Taking a sociocultural perspective that recognizes the role of social interaction in co-construction of knowledge and metacognition, we pose these research questions: How do scholars develop schema for quality engineering education research through collaboratively constructing peer reviews? What are the similarities and differences between schema development for manuscript and grant proposal review?The EER PERT program will enhance the quality of EER manuscripts and proposals, and ultimately increase the impact of scholarship in EER.

Tropical forests are regularly dismissed as fragile landscapes, providing inadequate resources to sustain large populations without substantial modification.

This project examines past settlement remains and environmental proxy data to assess interpretations of land use, sustainability, and adaptations to tropical forests. It will identify potentially sustainable agricultural practices from the past that can inform future development programs and policies. Long term land-management is essential in the contemporary tropics, which have endured extreme changes from deforestation and are projected to host the highest levels of future population growth.

These engineering innovators lacked connections to frontline healthcare decision-makers and were unfamiliar with the rigorous requirements of and processes related to the delivery of healthcare devices. Filling urgent shortfalls during a pandemic exemplifies the need to quickly assure safety while also considering rapid specification, design, scaling, testing and deployment. Therefore, this PFI RAPID project aims to develop, deploy, and evaluate the Connected Rapid Innovation System to meet Identified needs with Solutions (the CRISIS System) in order to satisfy supply chain shortages in Philadelphia, PA.

In Aim 1, the group proposes to build the connected system and associated processes to incorporate best practices in medical device development and enable efficient, purposeful, systematic innovation. In Aim 2, they will build the back-end for matchmaking (between device/product needs and technical expertise and resources) through the application of novel artificial intelligence methods in order to employ multiple data sources (from public data to private corporate data) as well as real-time estimations of the degree of matching.

It is a fundamental process that controls the evolution of Earth and holds a key to understanding important processes, such as earthquakes, volcanism, and mantle convection. However, how subduction initiates and how the tectonic plate changes its shape during subduction initiation (SI) are still unclear. The key driving forces are the negative buoyancy of the subducting plate and external forces that push the tectonic plates laterally. The key resisting forces include bending resistance of the subducting plate, frictional resistance between the subducting and overriding plates, and viscous resistance that is exerted by the surrounding mantle on the subducting plate. The details of SI and how the subducting plate bends depend strongly on the balance between these forces and also on the strength of the subducting slab, which has been defined by some combination of viscosity, elasticity, and plasticity of Earth materials. Further, these material prosperities are often assumed to be uniform in numerical simulations of SI despite their dependence on pressure, temperature, stress, and composition. Which of the three mechanical properties (i.e., viscosity, elasticity, and plasticity) controls the bending of the subducting plate depends on their relative values. Using numerical models, this study aims to better understand how the bending behavior of the subducting plate changes with the three mechanical properties. The project provides support for an early-career female faculty member and a postdoctoral scholar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A suite of generic 2-D and 3-D dynamic subduction models with a visco-plastic and a visco-elasto-plastic rheology will be developed to quantify the effect of elasticity on down-dip and lateral bending of the subducting slab. These models will incorporate a composite viscous rheology that accounts for both dislocation creep and diffusion creep, and models with the visco-elasto-plastic rheology incorporates pressure- and temperature-dependent shear modulus, using the thermodynamic code Perple_X. The models are used to address two key questions: (1) Can the negative buoyancy of the oceanic lithosphere be sufficient to overcome the elastic bending resistance and to initiate subduction, and (2) Is elasticity a rheological component that resists or facilitates down-dip and lateral bending/unbending? Systematic tests on the effect of subduction parameters on the slab evolution will also be performed to address these questions. Further, 2-D and 3-D models will be developed for selected real subduction systems, including Marianas, Tonga, and Puysegur, and the results will be compared with the tectonic history and the current slab geometry. The numerical models to be developed will provide not only the geometrical evolution of the slab but also the temperature and mantle flow fields of subduction systems over a range of parameters, and the information will be useful for the interpretations of geophysical and geochemical observations.

Shoot meristems generate organ initial cells, which undergo specific patterns of gene expression during growth and development to give rise to the complex pattern of cells and tissues found in the mature plant body. In this way, shoot meristems arise during embryonic stages and generate all the vegetative structures of the maize shoot. New advances in genomic technology now enable analyses of gene expression within individual cells obtained at all stages of maize development, which promises to generate novel insight into the genetic and genomic mechanisms of shoot development in this agronomically important crop plant. Embryos make shoot meristems and shoot meristems make organs. This study will examine the specific patterns of gene expression in individual cells throughout shoot development, from early embryonic stages before, during and after shoot meristem initiation, and during formation of vegetative organs such as leaves, stems, and branches. These studies will advance our understanding of the cell-specific mechanisms underlying pattern formation in the maize vegetative shoot, and of the structure and function of shoot meristems. This project will generate original data for public release, while providing a framework for scientific training and teaching of graduate students, undergraduates who are under-represented in science, and people incarcerated in upstate New York State prisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pattern formation in the maize shoot begins early in embryogenesis and occurs across multiple scales, from individual cells and tissues, to all the organs within the plant. Recent advances now enable analyses of maize pattern formation at single-cell resolution.  The maize shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a stem cell reservoir responsible for the development of all shoot-derived organs. This study will generate transcriptomic data from individual cells in the developing maize shoot, and will decipher the effects of cell position, cell signaling, rare cell types, and stochasticity on single-cell gene expression. Single-cell transcriptomic data will be obtained from key ontogenetic stages ranging from the establishment of embryonic axes, to formation of the SAM and the first lateral organs of the shoot, to the development of the seedling SAM and foliar leaf primordia, and during morphogenesis of the lateral branch meristems that will ultimately give rise to ears. Likewise, this project will investigate the single-cell transcriptomic networks within specific, functional domains of the vegetative SAM, and in wild type versus mutant shoot apices defective in leaf outgrowth to investigate the transcriptomic networks underlying maize shoot pattern formation throughout shoot ontogeny, at single-cell resolution.

Both type 1 (childhood onset) and type 2 (adult onset) diabetes are associated with the deficiency or impairment in beta-cells in the pancreas. These are the only cells in the body that secrete insulin, an essential hormone for blood glucose regulation. Engineered insulin-producing cells can reconstitute the impaired pancreatic beta-cell function, however, the large number of required cells poses challenges on the implantation device size, and supply of nutrients and oxygen, which results in rapid deterioration of implanted cells. This project aims to enhance insulin production in engineered beta-cells via optogenetic means, i.e., using a combination of genetics and optics.  Human beta cells will be genetically engineered to produce more insulin when activated by near-infrared window (NIRW) light.  NIRW light penetrates deep through tissues and can reach transplanted beta-cells better than light of other wavelengths.  The enhanced function of beta-cells means that fewer cells need to be transplanted to correct high blood glucose.  Once developed, the technique will be tested in a mouse model of diabetes.  The knowledge generated will inform the development of the next generation of technologies for efficient diabetes treatments. Educational activities, which are intertwined with the proposed research, will provide ample training opportunities for a new generation of high school, undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields. The knowledge and associated technologies generated through this work will be disseminated to the scientific community and the general public through online media, presentations, and publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to engineer human beta-cells with enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in response to near-infrared window (NIRW) light.  The project capitalizes on two recent advances from the collaborating laboratories. The first advance is demonstrating that rodent beta-cells expressing a blue light-activated adenylate cyclase (bPAC) for modulation of cAMP levels significantly (~3-fold) enhanced GSIS with no increase in oxygen consumption rate. After bPAC--cell transplantation, diabetic mice subjected to blue light display improved glucose tolerance, lower hyperglycemia and higher plasma insulin. The key deficiencies of the bPAC-prototype were limited activation due to poorly penetrating blue light, nonspecific cAMP effects due to intracellular mislocalization of bPAC, and the lack of human Beta-cells.  The second advance is a recently engineered adenylate cyclase activated by NIRW light (NIRW-AC) that will help overcome these deficiencies as it penetrates more deeply through mammalian tissue than blue light.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  OBJECTIVE 1 is to design a NIRW-AC with low dark activity, improved photoactivation range and optimized expression in human beta-cells. OBJECTIVE 2 is to engineer a light inducible system for localized, target-specific photoactivation of cAMP levels. The localization of the NIRW-AC will be tuned to mirror the localization of native ACs in beta-cells thereby reducing the nonspecific effects of cAMP and improving the long-term optogenetic performance of beta-cells.  OBJECTIVE 3 is to generate human beta-cells with NIRW light controlled enhancement of their GSIS.  This will encompass the biochemical and functional characterization of the engineered human beta-cells expressing the optimized NIRW-AC.  OBJECTIVE 4 is to test the performance of the NIRW-AC-expressing cells in a murine model of diabetes.

The results of this project will provide a deeper understanding of the social mechanisms that shape perceptions and behaviors to public policy responses in culturally and politically diverse contexts. Perceptions of disease (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, and threat) shape perceived barriers and benefits to action, which in turn affect behavior.

This work investigates the fundamental science underlying the interaction of programmed temperature-induced strains and the changes in shape upon heating of shape memory polymers. A process termed Programming-via-Printing will enable single-step fabrication of fully 3D, solid or porous devices with uniform or spatially varying functionality from individual, rather than composite, smart materials using 3D printers.

It will do so by investigating best practices for online tutoring in college mathematics.  Face-to-face tutoring in mathematics is known to correlate with positive learning outcomes including higher course grades, greater persistence, and improved retention. Providing quality online tutoring experiences also benefits for tutors by helping them learn valuable skills such as organization, time management, teamwork, problem-solving, leadership, and technical communication.  The COVID-19 pandemic forced many university-based tutoring services to either stop offering help to students or move online.  Many chose to move online.  However, the effective implementation of online mathematics tutoring is not yet well understood.  Such understanding is important because online mathematics tutoring could benefit students long after the current pandemic has dissipated. Preliminary observations have shown that online mathematics tutoring sessions typically serve as a homework service: tutors solve problems brought to them by students and the students watch and copy down the solutions rather than actively participating. This study aims to make the online tutoring experience more like the in-person experience by discovering ways to ensure students are active participants in tutoring sessions. Through continued observation of online tutor-student interactions, the project will identify tutor behaviors that encourage greater student participation in online tutoring sessions.  The project will then design training materials to promote the most effective behaviors in tutors.  These training materials will be freely distributed to the mathematics education community through workshops, conference presentations, and online resources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project\\u2019s online tutoring model will be tested and refined at West Virginia University and the University of Oklahoma, two large universities that server large populations of students.

Recorded online tutoring sessions will be analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis to identify tutor behaviors that promote student-centered tutoring interactions.  Pen and tablet technologies will be utilized and compared to online sessions without such tools to study specific impacts on tutor practices and student engagement.  Through multiple cycles of observation and implementation, a set of empirically tested training materials will be developed, including a Tutoring Manual for tutors and a Training Guide for tutoring center leaders/faculty. The Training Manual for tutors will contain resources such as technology suggestions (e.g., best collaborative whiteboard app; how to use your phone as a document camera; apps to scan written work to pdf), articles to read, and how to be an effective virtual coach.

Previous work has assumed Nd is exchanged between the water column and sediments in shallow parts of the ocean near continents, but models applying this process have difficulties reproducing observed distributions of Nd isotopes. This study will use a computer model to test a new idea: the bottom-up hypothesis, which suggests input of Nd from deep sea sediments to the water column everywhere in the ocean, including the deep abyssal plains far away from continents. Simulations of the ocean during the last ice age will be performed to explore the physical and chemical impacts from changes in ocean circulation at this time.

Structurally different model versions will be generated to explore the roles of scavenging, boundary exchange and benthic flux on dissolved and particulate Nd isotope distributions. New measurements of surface sediment Nd isotopes will fill gaps in the existing database, which will be used to model the isotopic composition of the benthic flux. Models will be comprehensively evaluated with GEOTRACES observations to test the hypothesis that a ubiquitous flux of Nd along the sea floor is the dominant source of Nd in the water column. Previous studies assume exchange only along upper ocean margins and conservative behavior in the interior, which suggests Nd isotopes are a water mass tracer without rate information. In contrast, the benthic flux hypothesis implies abyssal flow rate to be an important influence on Nd isotopes. This suggests that Nd isotope measurements from sediments could be used to infer rates of bottom water flow and the abyssal overturning circulation rate.

As a result, Latino students are underrepresented in higher level mathematics courses and careers involving mathematics.

Yet, little research has made central Latinos students' perspectives of learning and doing mathematics, especially over a critical period of time like the transition from elementary to middle school. The goal of this study will be to improve mathematics teaching and learning for Latino youth as they move from upper elementary to early middle school mathematics classrooms. The project involves three major parts: investigating the policy, media, and oral histories of Latino families/communities to understand the context for participating Latino students\\u2019 mathematics education; exploring Latino students\\u2019 stories about their experiences learning and doing mathematics to understand these students\\u2019 perspectives; and creating documentary video portraitures (or composite cases) of participants stories about learning and doing mathematics that can be used in teacher preparation and professional development.

It will also identify key factors that impact Latino students\\u2019 experiences in learning mathematics to pinpoint specific areas where interventions and programs need to be designed and implemented. An underlying assumption of the project is that carefully capturing and understanding Latino students\\u2019 stories can illuminate the strengths and resilience these students bring to their learning and doing of mathematics. This is a Faculty Early Career Development Program project responsive to a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. It was submitted to the Discovery Research K-12 program, which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project characterizes and analyses the developing mathematical identities of Latinx students transitioning from elementary to middle grades mathematics. The overarching research question for this study is: What are the developing stories of learning and doing mathematics of Latino students as they transition from elementary to middle school mathematics? To answer this question, this study is divided into three phases: 1) Understanding and documenting the historical context by examining policy documents, local newspaper articles, and doing focus group interviews with community members; 2) Using ethnographic methods over two years to explore students\\u2019 stories of learning and doing mathematics and clinical interviews to understand how they think about and construct arguments about mathematics (i.e., measurement, division, and algebraic patterning); and 3) Creating video-cases that can be used in teacher education. Traditional ways of teaching mathematics perpetuate images of who can and cannot do mathematics by not acknowledging contributions of other cultures to the mathematical sciences (Guti\\u00e9rrez, 2017) and the way mathematics has become a gatekeeper for social mobility (Martin, Gholson, &amp; Leonard, 2010; Stinson, 2004). Focusing on Latino students\\u2019 stories can illuminate teachers\\u2019 construction of equitable learning spaces and how they define success for their Latino students. The central hypothesis of this project is that elementary Latino students\\u2019 stories can identify how race and language are influential to their mathematical identities and how school and classroom practices may perpetuate inequities. Finally, the data and video-cases will then be used to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the development of the participating students\\u2019 developing mathematical identities.

The first goal of this project, led by researchers at Boston University and Northeastern University, is to understand the deeper conceptual nature of these biological misconceptions. The research will explore whether these ideas are specific to COVID-19 or whether they reflect intuitive reasoning patterns of reasoning about biological phenomena more generally, and how prevalent they are in early elementary school children. A further focus of this research will be on caregivers and teachers\\u2013adults who are important sources of information to children. Prior NSF-funded research has shown that misconceptions about biological phenomena emerge early in development and can become entrenched. Therefore, the second major goal of this research is the rapid design and testing of a pilot educational intervention that addresses children\\u2019s and adults\\u2019 reasoning about COVID-19 and also incorporates more general information about the causal mechanisms that underlie biological contagion. The intervention will be modeled on earlier interventions by the investigators that used animated narratives to teach complex biological concepts successfully to children and adults.

ECR supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans possess powerful intuitive explanatory and inferential tendencies that provide fast and efficient \\u2013 but sometimes fallible \\u2013 guidelines for making sense of complex phenomena in the biological world. Prior NSF-funded work has shown how these tendencies\\u2013for example, intuitive teleological, essentialist, and anthropocentric modes of reasoning\\u2013emerge early and act as filters on the learning of biological information at all ages. Sometimes these intuitions are consistent with formal biological reasoning and can be leveraged in the classroom to support learning, but sometimes they are not and lead to systematic and entrenched biological misconceptions across development. Information about COVID-19 is no exception. In this project, the researchers will: (1) investigate intuitive reasoning about the causal mechanisms of COVID-19 transmission and infection\\u2013along with reasoning about illness more generally\\u2013among teachers and caregivers of 1st - 2nd grade students; (2) conduct parallel investigations with the 1st - 2nd grade students themselves; and (3) rapidly design and pilot test a cognitively-informed educational intervention on COVID-19, and related illnesses, for elementary children, caregivers, and teachers based on the evidence that will be gleaned from these investigations. In order to understand the influence on children of adults\\u2019 reasoning about COVID-19\\u2013and disease more generally\\u2013this project will develop child and adult versions of a survey instrument consisting of: (a) an open-ended interview on the causality, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19; (b) a risky behavior detection task to assess knowledge and beliefs about the risks of common behaviors; (c) a causal knowledge assessment that asks more generally about the mechanisms of illness transmission and infection. These measures will be administered via online research. Insights gained from these measures will be quickly used to develop a pilot intervention that will use an animated narrative video to supported children's and adults\\u2019 mechanistic understanding of COVID-19 and related disease transmission and prevention. Pre- and post-testing will determine the effectiveness of this pilot intervention and lay the foundation for future research and intervention. This research will shed light on children\\u2019s and adults\\u2019 understandings about COVID-19, and the degree to which children\\u2019s ideas are shaped by intuitive explanatory tendencies and that misconceptions can be exacerbated by specific misinformation from caregivers and teachers.

One of the primary reasons why integration of CS into the K-12 curriculum remains elusive for rural districts is the lack of educators with CS expertise. Additionally, principals and counselors are often unaware of the importance and prevalence of CS to careers relevant to their communities. The SUCCESS team will address these issues by designing an ecosystem, including district and school level supports, that will ensure that all middle school students in predominantly rural WV have access to high quality CS education and an understanding of CS career opportunities. To reach its goal of increased CS access, SUCCESS will specifically work to increase teacher CS content knowledge, improve principal and counselor understanding of how to support teachers, and spread awareness of CS careers for students, teachers, counselors and principals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secure and Upgrade Computer Science in Classrooms through an Ecosystem with Scalability &amp; Sustainability (SUCCESS), will build an ecosystem to increase access to Computer Science (CS) and participation of underrepresented West Virginia (WV) middle school students in CS.

Recent research has revealed that surface topography has profound impact on microbe-material interactions and thus the safety of implanted medical devices. However, the mechanisms of such interactions and how to rationally design surface topographies to prevent infection while promoting host tissue integration are not well understood. This study is motivated by this knowledge gap and the recent reports of breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). BIA-ALCL is a well-recognized complication that has devastating impact on affected individuals, which has led to a decision of the Food and Drug Association (FDA) in 2019 to remove certain breast implants from the market. Despite this well-recognized challenge, the cause of BIA-ALCL remains elusive and a guideline for effectively regulating such devices is still missing. Through a prior Scholar-in-Residence at FDA project, the PI Ren and FDA co-PI Philips have obtained important new information about how bacteria interact with surface topographies, which led to this proposed new project. Through close collaboration, the team will conduct the first study on how implant surface topography affects bacterial quorum sensing and production of virulence factors, as well as the effects of surface topography on phagocytosis. The findings from this study will not only benefit the safety of breast implants, but also help guide the design and regulation of other devices. Beyond the research itself, the team will leverage this project to recruit young talents especially those from underrepresented groups and jointly advise graduate students. This project will help workforce development and better prepare civilly responsible engineers to solve challenging problems facing our society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During previous study, the team discovered that surface topographies mimicking the features of ALCL-associated breast implants have significantly higher bacterial loads than the flat control and the surfaces with other recessive patterns tested. In addition, the cell density in recessive wells were about 7 times higher than the flat control based on two-dimensional surface coverage after just 24 hours of culturing. The difference can be even bigger considering the three-dimensional biofilm structure and interaction with host factors, which will be studied in this project. Based on these findings, the team hypothesizes that inappropriate recessive features can promote bacterial biofilm formation, quorum sensing, and associated production of virulence factors. The team further hypothesizes that these topographic features present a physical hindrance for immune cells such as macrophages from reaching bacterial cells and cleaning them from the implant surface, leading to inflammation and subsequently BIA-ALCL. The team will test these hypotheses by conducting complementary experiments and cell tracking to understand how surface topography affects the interaction between bacteria and host cells. This new information will fill an important knowledge gap, and provide critical insights for understanding device-associated complications and the design of safer medical devices. The results will help FDA to better prepare for reviews of emerging technologies involving smart biomaterials.

Body size and longevity are two traits that vary tremendously across animals. Some species weigh less than a gram or live only several weeks, while others weigh thousands of kilograms or live for several hundred years. What could cause such remarkable variation in body size and lifespan? Turtles are a promising group to study this question because some species are extremely small, while others, like Galapagos tortoises, are gigantic and long-lived. Previous research suggests that Galapagos tortoises, along with some other large, long-lived animals like elephants, are particularly good at removing old or damaged cells from their bodies before they harm the individual \\u2013 a process called \\u201capoptosis\\u201d. In this project, the genomes of many turtle species will be compared to identify genes that may be responsible for the unique behavior of Galapagos tortoise cells. The effects of these genes will then be disrupted in Galapagos tortoise cells to see if it makes them behave more like other turtle cells. The goal is to characterize genes that can help explain the extraordinary diversity in body size and lifespan among animals. The results can also have important biomedical implications, since the same genes related to longevity may also be involved in aging related diseases and cancer. The project has a large outreach component including bioinformatics boot camps for high school students, freely available classroom case studies about the biology of longevity, and educational panels at zoos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Body size and longevity vary tremendously across animals, but the mechanisms underlying this variation are not well understood. At one extreme, certain species such as Galapagos and Aldabra giant tortoises have evolved remarkably large body sizes and long lifespans, despite the increased genotoxic and cytotoxic stress that comes with living longer and having more cells. Giant tortoises live approximately 3-5 times longer and weigh 50-100 times more than their closest relatives. Recent evidence suggests that Galapagos tortoises respond differently to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a set of events leading to the deregulation of protein homeostasis and one of the hallmarks of aging and reduced lifespan. Galapagos tortoises rapidly induce apoptosis in response to ER stress compared to cells from smaller, shorter-lived turtle species. In this project, comparative genomics will be used to identify ER stress-related genes that have been positively selected or duplicated/lost in large, long-lived tortoises versus their smaller, shorter-lived relatives. Genome editing will be used to knock down and characterize the cellular functions of ER stress candidate genes in turtle cell lines. The immediate aim is to identify the processes through which large, long-lived turtles have dealt with physiological constraints on body size and lifespan.

At the most basic level, the security of this task is derived from simple, low level, cryptographic primitives. A central question in this area is whether the code of the low level primitives is required to securely compute the desired function. This question has remained largely unexplored for the case of cryptographic functions. The project's novelties are new enhancements to classical cryptographic primitives, and a new paradigm to securely compute any function instantiated from them without requiring its full code. The project's impacts are discovery of new and general-purpose tools that have the potential to transform the area of black-box secure computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project takes a fresh look at the case of functions that depend only on input/output behavior of other cryptographic primitives and not their code. Existing methods to securely compute such functions require the code of the primitives they depend on even though the functions themselves do not. Such functions, referred to as nested black-box functions, happen to be a major source of inefficiency in secure computation. It is argued that if classical cryptographic primitives such as one-way functions admit sufficiently powerful secure computation protocols, it may be possible to avoid the need for their code when computing nested black-box functions instantiated from them.

This is important because the more ice on land that melts, the higher sea levels will rise. The most significant uncertainty in current estimates of sea-level rise in the coming decades is the potential contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One way to increase our knowledge about how large ice sheets respond to climate change in response to natural factors is to examine the geologic past. Natural global warming (and cooling) events in Earth\\u2019s history provide examples that we can use to better understand processes, interactions, and responses we can\\u2019t directly observe today. One such time period, approximately three million years ago (known as the Pliocene), was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are today and, therefore, represents a time period to study to better understand the ice sheet response to a warming climate. Specifically, this project is interested in understanding how ocean currents near Antarctica, which transport heat and store carbon, behaved during these past climate events. The history of past ice sheet-ocean interactions are recorded in sediments that were deposited, layer upon layer, in the deep sea offshore Antarctica. In January-February 2018, a team of scientists and crew set sail to the Ross Sea, offshore west Antarctica, on the scientific ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution to recover such sediment archives. This project focuses on a sediment core from that expedition, which captures the relatively warm Pliocene time interval, as well as the subsequent transition into cooler climates typical of the past two million years. The researchers will analyze the sediment with multiple complementary measurements, including: grain size, composition, chemistry of organic matter, physical structures, microfossil type and abundance, and more. These analyses will be done by the research team, including several students, at their respective laboratories and will then integrated into a unified record of ice sheet-ocean interactions. Ultimately, the results will be used to improve modeled projections of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet could respond to future climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Geological records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) margin demonstrate that the ice sheet oscillated in response to orbital variations in insolation (i.e., ~400, 100, 41, and 20 kyr), and it appears to be more sensitive to specific frequencies that regulate mean annual insolation (i.e., 41-kyr obliquity), particularly when the ice sheet extends into marine environments and is impacted by ocean circulation. However, the relationship between orbital forcing and the production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is unconstrained. Thus, a knowledge gap exists in understanding how changing insolation impacts ice marginal and Southern Ocean conditions that directly influence ventilation of the global ocean. The researchers hypothesize that insolation-driven changes directly affected the production and export of AABW to the Southern Ocean from the Pliocene through the Pleistocene. For example, obliquity amplification during the warmer Pliocene may have led to enhanced production and export of dense waters from the shelf due to reduced AIS extent, which, in turn, led to greater AABW outflow. To determine the relationship of AABW production to orbital regime, they plan to reconstruct both from a single, continuous record from the levee of Hillary Canyon, a major conduit of AABW outflow, on the Ross Sea continental rise. To test their hypothesis, they will analyze sediment from IODP Site U1524 (recovered in 2018 during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374) and focus on three data sets. (1) They will use the occurrence, frequency, and character of mm-scale turbidite beds as a proxy of dense-shelf-water cascading outflow and AABW production. They will estimate the down-slope flux via numerical modeling of turbidity current properties using morphology, grain size, and bed thickness as input parameters. (2) They will use grain-size data, physical properties, XRF core scanning, CT imaging, and hyperspectral imaging to guide lithofacies analysis to infer processes occurring during glacial, deglacial, and interglacial periods. Statistical techniques and optimization methods will be applied to test for astronomical forcing of sedimentary packages in order to provide a cyclostratigraphic framework and interpret the orbital-forcing regime. (3) They will use bulk sedimentary carbon and nitrogen abundance and isotope data to determine how relative contributions of terrigenous and marine organic matter change in response to orbital forcing. All of these data will be integrated with sedimentological records to deconvolve organic matter production from its deposition or remobilization due to AABW outflow as a function of the oscillating extent of the AIS. These data sets will be integrated into a unified chronostratigraphy to determine the relationship between AABW outflow and orbital-forcing scenarios under the varying climate regimes of the Plio-Pleistocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.916210174560547, \"y\": 5.71052360534668}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: AF: Small: Phase Transitions in Sampling Related Problems\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Graphical models are a widely used tool to succinctly represent high-dimensional data and to understand the fundamental building blocks and interactions of physical and biological systems.

However, if the models that robots use to predict, plan, and control their behaviors are inaccurate, it can lead to suboptimal or even dangerous behaviors.

An alternate approach is to learn the models from experience, but most such approaches need large amounts of data, in a variety of situations, which is practically infeasible to collect.  This project attempts to combine the strengths of hand-crafted, physics-based models and machine learning algorithms to tackle such problems.

Prominent approaches to summative evaluation of teaching candidates and beginning teachers feature video recordings of instructional practices. In addition, large-scale research studies have included video of instruction. Teacher preparation programs increasingly use video in methods courses and for formative assessment purposes. Moreover, the growing use of interactive simulation in pre-service preparation and in-service professional development relies on having video recorded examples of exemplary instructional practices. Despite the significant growth in the use of video to measure and promote instructional quality in recent years, there remain some key challenges to employing it at scale. First, it is very time-consuming for trained human raters to view hundreds of hours of video recorded lessons. Second, financial costs and time demands increase with the use of multiple human raters per video. Third, manually cataloging, labeling, and indexing large volumes of classroom video for later viewing is time consuming. Recent advances in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning may provide solutions to these challenges and could make the process of analyzing and scoring videos more efficient. In particular, deep learning has become the state-of-the-art choice in problems related to analyzing the content of video. This proposed NSF Core Research study will draw on videos of elementary mathematics instruction that were collected for two NSF-funded studies that featured the Mathematics-Scan (M-Scan) classroom observation tool. The research will use these videos to explore several ways that deep neural networks can be used to classify instructional activities in videos of math instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will advance knowledge and understanding by examining the degree to which three types of artificial neural networks can accurately classify (a) objects and (b) instructional activities in videos of elementary mathematics instruction. For example, it may be straightforward for neural networks to determine whether an elementary teacher is engaged in lecture vs. facilitating discussion with students. On the other hand, it may be harder for such networks to assess the ways teachers represent math content, the nature of their questions, and whether student gestures signify understanding. The research design concerns three aspects of using computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning: (a) the type of neural network, (b) the type of video label (i.e., object labels and instructional activity labels), and (c) the subject of math instruction (e.g., number and operations; patterns, functions, and algebra; geometry). A few types of neural networks have recently proven effective for video classification: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and hybrid CNN-LSTMs. Ultimately, this project is aimed at beginning to build systematic infrastructure for classifying videos of classroom instruction at scale in efficient and affordable ways. The findings will potentially have key implications for (a) large-scale research studies that feature videos of instruction and (b) pre-service teacher preparation programs, in-service professional development activities, and efforts to evaluate teaching candidates and practicing teachers. In particular, the results from this study will inform decisions about the types of neural networks that can be used to correctly classify videos of instruction and the practical limitations of using networks for this purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.1089224815368652, \"y\": 8.367517471313477}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Rapid: Collaborative Research: Agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats through open data and open analytics\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The same types of questions arise during every emergent viral outbreak regarding its origin, its evolution, the manner of spread, and how to detect and mitigate it.

Essential questions such as the extent of intra-host genomic variability (indicative of adaptation or multiple infection), viral evolution (selection, recombination), transmission (phylogentic and phylogeographic) cannot be answered reliably if researchers cannot trust/replicate the source data and analytical approaches.

Nanoparticles can vary in elemental composition, structure, and properties, which makes them useful for industries ranging from electronics, to batteries, to cosmetics. As nanoparticle use becomes more widespread, however, they are appearing in the environment.  When nanoparticles are incorporated into biological systems they may induce unusual behavior that is beneficial or harmful, but is as of yet poorly understood. For instance, due to their small size, some nanoparticles can easily pass through some cell membranes. With very high surface area to volume ratios, nanoparticles can also be highly reactive, which may trigger chemical changes in the environment or to the nanoparticle itself. The CSN applies a \\\"make, measure, model\\\" strategy to develop new functional nanomaterials with increased sustainability and reduced biological impact. Expertise with synthetic methods, in situ analytical techniques, and computational methods is leveraged to understand, predict, and control nanoparticle properties and their chemical interactions with the environment and biological systems. The CSN addresses key knowledge gaps in the areas of nanoparticle properties which will result in better prediction of specific nanoparticle chemical properties and their biological interactions. This will ultimately serve the national interest by allowing for the design of more effective and more benign nanoparticles for many applications. Some of the systems the CSN investigates include: transition metal oxides and phosphates and two-dimensional quantum materials; gold, diamond and silicon based nanoparticles with defined organic and inorganic surface coatings; and as well as emerging nanoparticle compositions that exhibit fundamental new science and utility, such as those based on polymeric carbon dots, and nanovacancies in nanodiamond. This integrated, multi-institutional, and collaborative team involves researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Minnesota, Boston University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Augsburg University, University of California-Riverside, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Iowa, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental Station. The Center has a strong innovation component that involves the translation of research results into intellectual property, as well as other collaborations with several industrial partners. The CSN has an inclusive and transparent management approach that enables a positive Center climate and facilitates the integration of student learning across Center activities. Students broaden and deepen their technical expertise and grant writing through student laboratory exchanges and seed grant opportunities. The CSN places special emphasis on communication training. Example mechanisms to develop student communication skills are the popular Sustainable Nano Blog, http://sustainable-nano.com/, and the Spanish language-based Nano Sostenible Blog, http://nano-sostenible.com/. These are key components of the Center's informal science communication efforts, and students have ample opportunity to participate in these educational websites. Webinars on fostering technical innovation, internship opportunities, and opportunities to serve on the advisory board are mechanisms through which students further develop their professional skill sets. The CSN is committed to broadening participation efforts and incorporates summer research experiences for undergraduates and veterans, and relationships with minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and community colleges as ways to address inclusivity. The strong focus on the CSN climate helps to ensure all participants feel welcomed, valued, and supported. Partnerships with the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey and Rio Piedras, the University of Texas Rio Grand Valley, Tuskegee University, and Georgia State University help to ensure that a diverse group of students can participate in the CSN where they develop not only the skills mentioned above, but also an understanding of the need to approach questions in chemistry with an awareness of sustainability, inclusivity, and interdisciplinarity. The CSN experience will prepare participants to make unique future contributions as members of the chemical workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSN organizes their goals along four focus areas. One area focuses on establishing nanoparticle structure\\u2013function relationships. Chemical composition, size, shape, and organic or inorganic surface modifications are investigated with a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Transition metal oxides, nanoparticles comprised of earth-abundant elements, and nanoparticles that demonstrate novel properties or new utility are focal points. A second area of investigation centers on understanding nanoparticle transformations that occur in the environment and in biological media. Chemical changes in the nanoparticle core, the roles of inorganic and organic ions to impact nanoparticle stability, and surface structure are some of the areas explored. The third CSN thrust area explores nanoparticle coatings, referred to as coronas, formed by their exposure to the environment or biological systems at aqueous interfaces as a function of time. Analytical and computational approaches are developed to characterize and model the chemical nature and formation mechanisms of nanoparticle coronas. The fourth area is a chemistry-focused investigation of the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with biological systems. Nanoparticles with well-defined composition, structure, and surface chemistry are used to correlate, better understand, and predict nanoparticle physicochemical properties, spatial and temporal interactions at biological surfaces, and the direct or indirect effects on molecular interactions in cells and organisms. The CSN enriches the chemistry community by providing new tools for characterizing chemical processes at nanoparticle surfaces and by developing experimentally validated computational methods to predict the molecular-level behavior of complex materials in aqueous media. CSN participants are engaged in activities aimed at facilitating the creation and dissemination of knowledge, enhancing innovation and translation of research products and outcomes to the commercial sector, and providing unique education and training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.243171691894531, \"y\": 7.474818706512451}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"SBIR Phase I:  Light Emitting Diode Pixel Circuit Incorporating Thin Film Electronics Based on Amorphous Metals\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new circuit for controlling micro light emitting diode (LED) and organic light emitting diode (OLED) flat panel displays with variable refresh rate.

The result enables transformative improvements to applications demanding pervasive, long-lived, and autonomous intelligent sensing systems, including industrial automation, infrastructure monitoring, agriculture, environmental sciences, healthcare, defense, and space exploration. The resulting software and hardware systems along with collected energy data of this project will be made publicly available for scientists, engineers, educators, and industry to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.729135990142822, \"y\": 8.70130443572998}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Chemical Toolbox for Deciphering the Molecular Origins of Selectivity in Human Extracellular Sulfatases\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding the research of Dr. Kamil Godula at the University of California \\u2013 San Diego, to study the effects of two human enzymes known as Sulf1 and Sulf2. These enzymes act on the exterior of cell surfaces by recognizing and modifying the patterns of negatively charged groups on sugar polymers that are part of the outside coating of cells. In doing so they control the activity of proteins involved in critical cell signaling and development events. Despite being a key element in regulating important cellular functions, the structures of these enzymes and the sugars they act on are still poorly understood.  Additionally, their precise actions in a cellular context need better understanding.  This research project develops a set of new tools and techniques at the interface of chemistry and biology to fill the gaps in the basic understanding of the biological functions of these enzymes. These activities allow graduate students to obtain training in the interdisciplinary area of chemical biology focusing on carbohydrate chemistry and biology.  The students also gain a deeper understanding of the varied roles of carbohydrates in biology.  The educational and technical resources enabled by this award allow for the dissemination of the knowledge, tools, and techniques stemming from this research project to the broader research community and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops novel methods to produce human sulfatase enzymes enabling detailed investigations of structure and mechanism. New chemical glycomics tools are envisioned to capture and structurally characterize the polysaccharide substrates for these enzymes. Further, biochemical and cell-based assays are under development to investigate their function during embryonic stem cell differentiation. The sulfatase enzymes are thought to have specificity for unique negatively charged regions of their sulfated polysaccharide substrates complementing the organization of positively charged residues in their substrate-binding domains. However, little information exists regarding the structure of the enzymes and the composition of their preferred substrates. Arrays comprising structurally defined sulfated polysaccharides from synthetic and biological sources are in use to identify preferred substrates for the sulfatase enzyme isoforms and to delineate how the enzymatic removal of sulfates from the polysaccharides impacts their interactions with growth factors. The chemical toolbox includes substrate-based fluorogenic probes for imaging sulfatase activity in biological environments and reactive molecules for chemical fingerprinting of substrates for structural characterization by mass spectrometry analysis. In combination, these tools are deployed to map how sulfatase enzymes control growth factor signaling during neural and mesenchymal differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells. The tools are general and suitable for the investigation of other biological systems where extracellular sulfatases exert important regulatory functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.526889801025391, \"y\": 6.111759185791016}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Timescales of Crystallization, Ore Formation, and\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The thermal evolution of a magma chamber is the primary control on the geochemical evolution of a magma, its eruption potential, and the development of valuable PGE and hydrothermal ore bodies. Traditionally, large magma chambers are thought to cool and crystallize very slowly, allowing for significant physical and chemical reorganization to occur.  New geochronologic age data from U-Pb in the mineral zircon and Ar-Ar in the minerals biotite and plagioclase from the world?s largest exposed magma chamber, the Bushveld Complex of South Africa, have recently challenged this long-standing assumption, and suggested that the Bushveld cooled very rapidly from its molten state (approximately 1200-1300\\u00b0C) down to the ambient crustal temperature (between 150- 300\\u00b0C).  The work proposed here will specifically test several possible cooling paths from the liquid state to the point at which the magma is completely solidified (between 800-900\\u00b0C) as well as cooling paths from the solid state down to the ambient crustal geotherm.  The results will have major implications for two societally relevant issues.  First, quantification of the timescale of solidification in large magma chambers will inform modern day volcanic hazard monitoring during magma recharge events and volcanic eruptions.  Second, quantifying how fast magmas solidify and evolve will inform our understanding of when and how valuable and strategic metal deposits form (the Bushveld Complex of South Africa contains over 70% of the world?s proven Platinum reserves and numerous other important and strategic metals). In addition, the mid-low temperature cooling rate results will also provide an estimate of the rate of paleo-magnetic reversals (of which there are 7 in the Bushveld Complex) over 2 billion years ago.  The rate of magnetic reversals is related to the dynamics of inner core solidification and formation of the geodynamo, which is not well understood beyond the last 500 million years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will employ a combination of six separate geothermometers and geochronometers with a range of closure temperatures (Tc).  The PI and students will quantify the liquidus temperature at each level of stratigraphy using the plagioclase-pyroxene and/or pyroxene-pyroxene REE thermometer (Study 1).  The high-temperature cooling rate will be determined using the Ca in orthopyroxene and Ca-Mg exchange in two pyroxenes thermometers (Study 2).  The solidus temperature and absolute age of the solidus will be quantified by U-Pb zircon thermochronology already in progress, and the Ti-in-zircon thermometer (Study 3).  The mid-low temperature cooling history will be quantified by Ca diffusion in olivine (Study 4) and Fe-Ti oxides (Study 5).  The low-temperature cooling ages will be determined by Ar-Ar thermochronology in plagioclase, biotite, and hornblende mineral pairs (Study 6).  The advantage of this approach is that the cooling rates determined by diffusion and solvus thermometry will be bracketed at high and low temperature by absolute ages from U-Pb and Ar-Ar thermochronology.  Additional implications not mentioned above include: quantification of the evolution of oxygen fugacity during fractional crystallization; and, investigation of the rates and processes of hydrothermal ore formation (specifically Zn, F, Sn) during mid-low temperature hydrothermal circulation and contact metamorphism.  &lt;br/&gt;\", \"x\": 8.020425796508789, \"y\": 6.361818313598633}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"A New Design Paradigm in Low Band Gap Conjugated Polymers\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Seth C. Rasmussen of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at North Dakota State University to advance fundamental understanding of structure-function relationships in conjugated polymers.  Conjugated polymers are long chain, organic molecules. Much like traditional semiconductors such as silicon, these polymers can become conductive when one applies a voltage (such as in transistors) or light (such as in solar cells).  This team creates design strategies for constructing new types of conjugated polymers with potential applications in organic electronics, photovoltaics and organic light-emitting diodes.  In addition to conventional synthetic techniques, computational modelling is used to evaluate potential polymer structures and to predict their electronic properties. The broader activities associated with this research focus on outreach to Native American colleges via the university\\u2019s NATURE program.  The team also contributes to the history of polymer science and technology via the documentation and dissemination of new historical publications on the origin and growth of conjugated polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on advancing understanding of structure-function relationships in conjugated polymers, in particular the role of donor-acceptor interactions in efforts to produce reduced band gap (Eg=1.5-2.0 eV) and low band gap (Eg&lt;1.5 eV) polymers.  The band gap is a critical parameter of organic semiconducting materials, particularly for their application in electrochromic devices, organic photovoltaics, organic light-emitting diodes, and NIR photodetectors. Of particular focus here is the application of a new design paradigm that pairs conventional acceptor units with thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine building blocks.  These building block act simultaneously as very strong acceptors and very strong donors. The preparation of the conjugated polymers is accomplished using direct arylation polymerizations. Computational techniques aid in experimental design, predicting desired electronic properties.  This new design paradigm is applied to other monomers such as acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine, dibenzo[f,h]thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline and thieno[3',4':5,6]pyrazino[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthroline, and some of the materials are tested in devices via established collaborations.

These results can be relayed to the user immediately and a real-time outbreak map along with affected demographics can be produced.  This approach off-loads the burden of diagnostics from health workers, eliminates the increased use of limited personal protective equipment, and provides a better response to outbreaks.  Resources could be more efficiently allocated by local and federal governments, and workers could make more informed decisions on staying at home or going to work.  Moreover, this project will train a team of four students to collaborate quickly together to meet the design constraints of an actual product based on technologies from their thesis work.

During the summer, student participants spend 10 weeks at the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The targeted student participants are gender, racially, and ethnically diverse, representing a broad spectrum of colleges throughout the nation including community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and those with limited research opportunities. During their time at Penn, students are introduced to materials research as a cohesive subject of study. Students are active participants in research groups of faculty affiliated with the LRSM, receiving access to state-of-the-art facilities to conduct authentic research and mentoring experiences similar to those of graduate students in the same groups. Depending on their interests and educational background, REU research activities can range from synthesizing new polymers, to probing the optical properties of quantum dots, to measuring mechanical responses of soft materials such as colloids and emulsions, to computing electronic band structures of topological insulators and yet-to-be-synthesized composite materials. To extend their research experience, students participate in a weekly research seminar to absorb front-line materials science and engineering and learn to present their research findings both orally and in a written report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.7239227294921875, \"y\": 7.557158470153809}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Shunt or shuttle? Nutrient-driven biogeochemical consequences of diatom host-virus interactions\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Diatoms are a type of microscopic marine algae that form the base of the ocean food web and generate about 20% of the oxygen on the planet. Admired since the Victorian age, these organisms are often referred to as the \\u2018glass houses of the sea\\u2019 because of the intricate architecture of their cell walls made of silicon dioxide, or glass. When these organisms die, the cellular-associated carbon and other elements can be either recycled and reused by other phytoplankton or, because glass is heavier than seawater, lost by sinking out of the surface ocean. Thus, the contribution diatoms make to carbon cycling is dictated by the balance between the factors that facilitate recycling and those that stimulate export. As the most abundant entity in the ocean, viruses have, for decades, been characterized as efficient recyclers, acting as \\u2018shunts\\u2019 by preventing the transfer of energy up the food chain through host mortality and lysis. However, it has been suggested that viruses may also act as \\u2018shuttles\\u2019 to the deep ocean, stimulating cellular processes that facilitate sinking. This project is testing this emerging hypothesis and determining how different nutrient regimes influence the fate of diatoms through impacts on viral infection dynamics and death. This is particularly timely given major national and international initiatives currently seeking to quantify how ecosystem interactions regulate carbon export in the ocean. Results of this project have the potential to challenge the canonical role of diatom viruses in carbon cycling and transform the understanding of host-virus interactions in the ocean. This project provides critical funding support for a soft-money, underrepresented, female oceanographer, as well a graduate student and undergraduates. Proposed fieldwork leverages a Rutgers and European Union-funded project, fostering ongoing collaborations with researchers at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples, Italy. To facilitate ocean literacy, the PIs are working with the Rutgers\\u2019 Education and Outreach team to conduct a series of Teen Cafes focused on carbon cycling, phytoplankton, and viruses utilizing the \\u2018Tools of Science\\u2019 (ToS), a series of educational videos and lesson plans designed to introduce middle, high school, and undergraduate students in underrepresented and underserved communities to core scientific practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diatoms contribute almost 40% of marine primary productivity, dominating the biological pump and disproportionately contributing to carbon export due to the ballasted nature of a silica-based cell wall. The contribution of diatoms to carbon sequestration is dictated by the balance between upper ocean remineralization and sinking, yet we still cannot explain widespread spatio-temporal variability in diatom-mediated export. As the most abundant predatory entities in the ocean, viruses play a critical role in shaping microbial ecosystems and driving global biogeochemical cycles. The premise of this proposal is that nutrient regimes drive the biogeochemical consequences of diatom host-virus interactions. For decades, the role of viruses as \\u2018shunts\\u2019, redirecting particulate matter away from higher trophic levels and into the dissolved fraction through host lysis, has dominated microbial ecology and marine virology. However, the idea that viruses may also act as \\u2018shuttles\\u2019, facilitating carbon export by stimulating aggregation and/or ballast production, is now emerging as a potential mechanism for carbon flux. This project is conducting laboratory-based studies on diverse diatom host-virus systems and manipulative studies on natural diatom communities to compare the impact of viral infection on processes that facilitate sinking \\u2013 mineral ballast production and particle aggregation \\u2013 to those that stimulate remineralization \\u2013 bacterial-mediated hydrolysis and subsequent remineralization of diatom particulate organic matter and silica. Taken together, this work is characterizing the relative balance between these diametrically opposing outcomes within the ecophysiological context of nutrient regime (specifically, silicon and iron limitation), ultimately elucidating the impact of viral infection on the fate of diatom organic matter in the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.335314750671387, \"y\": 5.592231273651123}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Saving Seniors\\u2019 Lives: Comparing the Efficiency and Equity of Medicare and the Clean Air Act\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This research project will study the relative effectiveness of two public policies---Medicaid expenditure and air quality regulation---used to reduce mortality among Americans over age 65.

Soil moisture detection using drones can help predict crop yield and fertilizer requirement, thus benefitting precision agriculture. Detection of the caloric values of liquids and of water contamination have important health-care applications.

To encourage social distancing, many states have closed schools and nonessential businesses and instituted \\u201cStay-at-Home\\u201d orders that limit trips to necessary activities such as grocery shopping and medical care. While Stay-at-Home orders are typically considered mandatory, most states rely on voluntary compliance rather than penalize infractions through citations or arrests. A persistent concern throughout the crisis has been the extent to which individuals are choosing to practice social distancing effectively in order to slow the growth of the pandemic. Yet, to date, virtually no systematic information has emerged on differences in social distancing across social groups by income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood and, critically, why these differences exist. This project will address this gap by collecting detailed data on social distancing practices during the COVID-19 pandemic \\u2013 including the timing and location of non-home trips over the course of a week \\u2013 from a sample of youth and their caregivers in the Columbus, OH area. The study will build on an ongoing project focused on differences in patterns of everyday activity under normal (non-pandemic) conditions). Enhanced effectiveness of social distancing holds the potential to save millions of lives, reduce the burden to inevitably taxed health care systems during pandemics, and mitigate potential longer-term damage to the US and global economies due to ineffective pandemic containment. Findings from the project will provide crucial guidance to policy-makers who must target interventions to most effectively contain viral outbreaks and address the needs of the most vulnerable populations during pandemics. Findings will also provide important information for epidemiologists who must model disease spread based on realistic assumptions regarding social distancing practices across the population. Finally, clinicians will also benefit from more precise information on infection risk profiles at the individual level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COVID-19 has prompted requirements for social-distancing, and yet we know little about who complies and who does not.

Objective 1 of the study will investigate the association between income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood economic disadvantage and typical (pre-pandemic) exposure to higher infection risk locations as captured by the density of social interaction at those places. These data will shed light on infection risk during the early stages of the pandemic before social distancing behaviors were widely adopted. The study will leverage unique data from the baseline study on the geographic location and associated characteristics of everyday places visited based on a novel survey-based method for the collection of geographically-referenced activity data. Objective 2 of the study will re-administer this location data collection approach during the peak period of the pandemic to measure income, race/ethnicity and neighborhood variation in the extent of social distancing behaviors for both caregivers and youth.

This can have serious security implications for applications such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Domain Validation ((DV), that proves an organization owns an Internet domain such as www.example.com before issuing a certificate that the organization can present to web browsers as authentication).  A side channel is a mechanism where information flows where it was not intended to flow according to the design of a system.  An analogy might be a foreign government counting the number of pizza deliveries to the Pentagon and inferring last-minute planning for a big event when the number of pizzas increases sharply.  In other contexts, side channels have led to fundamental breakdowns in the basic security mechanisms that separate processes in an operating system (see Meltdown and Spectre, which are vulnerabilities in the way computers enforce the most basic separation of security contexts), and have been used to crack even then strongest cryptography.  The TCP and IP protocols lay the foundation for the Internet, but are known to be susceptible to side channels if certain requirements are not met.  Requests for Comments (RFCs), (the documents that develop and define Internet standards) describe how, for example, certain numbers must be chosen in an unpredictable manner, or limiting the rate at which packets are sent must be applied in a specific way, in order to mitigate the effects of TCP/IP side channels.  Failure to follow these RFCs undermines the most basic assumption of Internet security: that in order for an attacker to infer the existence of, interfere with, or inject their own data into a communication the attacker must control a part of the network in between the two parties that are communicating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violating this basic assumption can be devastating for Internet users that are acting in the U.S.'s interest, such as journalists, activists, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) overseas that use tunneling of some kind to bypass Internet controls in their own country.  A major technical challenge that the project will address is to explore the astronomically large number of possibilities for how sequences of probes sent by researchers might result in predictable patterns in the responses given by different Internet hosts.  Predictable patterns indicate a vulnerability because the security model assumes an attacker will not be able to guess the numbers that protocols use for sequencing and other purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines expertise in network security and data mining to search the Internet for patterns where there should be none.

With a radius that is slightly larger than the planet Mars, the core sits roughly ~2900 km below Earth\\u2019s surface. The fluid outer core holds high importance for a number of reasons, including the generation of Earth\\u2019s magnetic field, and being an important mechanism to transfer heat to the mantle, which helps to drive the convective engine responsible for plate tectonics.  In the past few decades, geophysicists have detected a thin shell at the top of the outer core where seismic waves appear to slow down, suggesting some form of stratification in the fluid.  However, the seismic models for this shell do not all agree, which motivates further study. A principle challenge in seismically imaging the outer core is that seismic waves from earthquakes that are used to study the core have to travel through the entire mantle of the Earth twice (down and then back), and the mantle is very heterogeneous, with seismic velocities that vary with position.  Thus, how can seismologists determine if patterns in measured signals are due to anomalous outermost core structure versus heterogeneities in Earth\\u2019s mantle?

The team of four seismologists will collect seismic data from earthquakes and seismic sensors from all over the world, predict the observations using state of the art seismic wavefield computations, and conduct refined measurements on the signals that are sensitive to deep mantle and outer core parts of the planet.  The expected outcome is a better understanding of the degree to which Earth\\u2019s heterogeneous mantle affects measurements of data to study the core, and to produce an improved model of the outermost core by using the best data which are demonstrated to be minimally affected by the mantle.  Better seismic mapping of Earth\\u2019s outermost core will inform research that aims to understand the enigmatic nature of the magnetic field, heat flow from the core to the mantle, as well as possible chemical exchange between the mantle and core which is important for understanding the chemical evolution of the planet.  All four seismologists on the team will share results with the public in a variety of venues (including the classroom, public presentations, and science fairs) to promote awareness of the importance of Earth and planetary interiors in shaping phenomena experienced at the surface. The project will train several graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismically imaged P wave velocity (Vp) reductions in the outermost 50-400 km of the core imply the presence of a stably stratified layer overlying the deeper, separately convecting interior. The precise thickness and nature of the reduced velocity (and density) layer holds critical significance for geodynamo models that address making Earth\\u2019s magnetic field, as well as the ability to understand core composition and mineralogy. However, in over ~30 years of seismic studies, no consensus has emerged among seismologists on either the thickness of the layer or the velocity structure within it. This is likely due to the effects of mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy on the seismic data used to probe the uppermost outer core. This project will investigate travel time, wave path, waveform, and shear wave splitting anomalies of seismic waves that travel in the outermost core, including multiple reflections from the underside of the core-mantle boundary (\\u201cSmKS\\u201d waves), which are more sensitive to outer core structure than any other seismic wave, in order to identify and mitigate the effects of mantle structure on outer core models. To accomplish this, a method that sums seismograms at geographically localized seismic sub-arrays will be used to improve the clarity of weak signals relative to noise, which can improve upon identification of contamination from mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy. 3D wavefield synthetics will be used to benchmark how 1D outer core imaging tools are affected by mantle heterogeneity. New outermost core seismic models will subsequently be determined in forward and inverse experiments based on highest-quality data that have been corrected for the effects of mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy. Thus, this project will thus directly test the longstanding (but likely imperfect) assumption that differential SmKS travel times can be used to reliably retrieve outer core structure without explicitly considering the effects of mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy. In addition to producing new models of outer core structure based on high-quality, corrected data, this project will produce complementary data products that contain new insights into lower mantle velocity heterogeneity and anisotropy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 8.022420883178711, \"y\": 6.586103439331055}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: EAGER-QIA: High-Genus Code-Based Cryptography\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Cryptography protects confidential communications: electronic commerce, voter information, diplomatic communication, human-rights interviews, medical records, and much more.

In high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, criminal justice, scientific discovery, education, and others, the resulting predictive models are complex, and in many cases, black-boxes. Consider for example, a medical decision making scenario where a predictive model, e.g., a deep neural network, trained on a large database of labeled data, is to assist physicians in diagnosing patients. In this setting, it is important that the clinical decision support system be able to explain the output of the deep neural network to the physician, who may not have a deep understanding of machine learning. For example, the physician might want to understand the subset of patient characteristics that contribute to the diagnosis; or the reason as to why diagnoses were different for two different patients, etc. In high stakes applications of machine learning, the ability to explain the machine learned model is a prerequisite for establishing trust in the model\\u2019s predictions. Satisfactory explanations have to provide answers to questions such as: \\\"What features of the input are responsible for the predictions?\\\"; \\\"Why are the model\\u2019s outputs different for two individuals?\\\" (e.g., Why did John\\u2019s loan application get approved when Sarah\\u2019s was not?).

The planned methods do not require knowledge of the internal structure or parameters of the black-box model, or of the objective function or the algorithm used to train the model. Hence, the resulting methods can be applied, in principle, to any black-box predictive model, so long as it is possible probe the model and observe the model\\u2019s response to any supplied input data sample.

Nectar is produced from a tissue called the nectary, which can be found on various parts of the plant, including leaves and flowers. Despite this important character, outstanding questions remain to be addressed about the evolution of nectar and nectaries, particularly in the monocots, a group of plants that include grasses and orchids and agriculturally important crops, such as corn, wheat, pineapple, banana, and palm. Most monocots have septal nectaries, a distinctive type of nectary not found in any non-monocot plant. Hypotheses about the septal nectary have been proposed, and genetics may provide an additional lens to address these hypotheses. However, nothing is known about the genetic underpinnings of septal nectaries. By using living plant collections at the UCLA Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden, the Huntington Botanical Gardens, and California Botanic Garden, along with advanced imaging and sequencing technologies, insights will be made into the evolution of nectaries and how the septal nectary may have contributed to the diversification of monocots.

These analyses will determine whether septal nectaries have similar genetic and developmental programming compared to more well-studied flowering plants.

If a problem's resolution depends on the aggregate of its information then geometric methods are useful in detecting global obstructions. Numerous problems across mathematics and its applications are global in this sense, ranging from data science to economics. The research supported by this grant will develop new topological and geometric methods to tackle problems further afield, primarily discrete, non-continuous problems. This promises new insights at the confluence of combinatorics, geometry, and topology. Students at all stages will be involved in the research effort supported by this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the general goals of the research program are the following: In applications of equivariant topology one often requires that a certain parameter has to be a prime power, and methods fail outside of this prime power case. Recent research of the PI has suggested that one may effectively circumvent this prime power requirement via a synthesis of topological and combinatorial techniques. This will be further developed. The application of topological methods brings about geometric generalizations of combinatorial problems. To understand the limitations of topological techniques one has to study those types of problems, where geometric results deviate considerably from their combinatorial special cases. A central goal will thus be to delimit rigid combinatorial results from their flexible geometric counterparts. In addition to showing the existence of a solution to some combinatorial problem, one is often interested in quantifying how rich the space of solutions is. General topological methods will be developed that provide lower bounds for the topology of the space of solutions of a given combinatorial problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.114596366882324, \"y\": 9.882554054260254}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"A Mid-Term Assessment of NSF Progress on the 2015 \\u2018Strategic Vision for Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research\\u2019\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The Polar Research Board will conduct a consensus study to assess progress in addressing research goals outlined in its 2015 report: A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research.

The major goal of this research is to develop a predictive understanding of the role of microbes as drivers of Critical Zone biogeochemistry and soil formation. The researchers\\u2019 preliminary investigations across the former Critical Zone Observatory Network identified variable patterns in microbial biodiversity with increasing soil depth across sites, with some sites showing little to no change with depth, and others a complete turnover of the microbial community members.

Specifically, where soils are deep or are derived from nutrient- rich bedrock, the researchers hypothesize that rooting depths will be greater, resulting in a greater similarity between surface and deep soil microbial communities compared to those from shallower soils or those developed from less nutrient-rich substrates. In this proposed project, the researchers will use a novel combination of DNA and RNA sequencing, real-time soil gas and environmental monitoring, quantified enzyme activities, detailed soil organic matter and isotopic analyses, as well as root abundances to address the hypothesis. To amplify the impact of this approach, the project will develop a unique and detailed geomicrobiology characterization of key indicator species of bacteria, archaea and fungi, grouped to distinguish those that are surface-based and those representative of bedrock interactions.

Mergers of compact binary systems including neutron stars and black-holes of all mass ranges encode information about fundamental physics, demonstrate the behavior of matter in the most extreme environments in the Universe, give insights into the formation, acceleration and dissipation of the most powerful particle emission processes, and provide missing links in our understanding of the end stages of stellar evolution and of their astrophysical origin.

But the climatic effect of clouds is an aggregate effect over a bewildering variety of cloud types, structures, and sizes.  In principle this aggregate effect can be calculated on a cloud-by-cloud basis, simulating all clouds in detail and then adding up their individual contributions. But such simulations are impractical and in any case do not provide a satisfactory explanation for cloud behaviors. An alternative approach is to look for ways in which the fine-scale properties of clouds are determined, at least approximately, by the bulk properties of the large-scale atmosphere.  This approach has the advantage of focusing on cloud properties which are likely to be influenced by climate change and may act to amplify or moderate the amount of warming caused by greenhouse gas increases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent work the PIs have developed a theory in which the stratification of the large-scale atmosphere exerts a thermodynamic constraint on the fine-scale complexity of tropical convective clouds. The theory assumes a quasi-equilibrium state in which convective potential energy generated by solar heating at ground level is dissipated by horizontal turbulent mixing between rising air in clouds and surrounding clear air, which has lower potential energy. Since the sides of a cloud constitute a boundary through which mixing occurs across a potential energy drop, the theory implies a relationship between the length of cloud perimeter on a surface of atmospheric potential energy (specifically saturated static energy) and the stability of the atmosphere to overturning motions at that level.  In quasi-equilibrium this relationship further implies that the number of clouds with a given perimeter length is inversely proportional to that perimeter length.  Also, the mass flux through the sides of a cloud is related to the potential energy difference between the cloud and its environment.  This relationship can be used to show that clouds of high convective potential energy are exponentially more rare than clouds of lower potential energy (a form of the Boltzmann distribution).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work under this award tests the theory's predictions regarding the perimeter and energy dependence of cloud occurrence using satellite observations and model simulations.  Further work addresses the extent to which the relationship between cloud number and perimeter length can be used to infer the number of clouds with a given horizontal area (possibly following Korcak's law), as cloud area has a direct connection to the climatic effects of clouds.  Finally, the implications of the theory for changes in tropical convective clouds in response to climate change will be explored. Atmospheric stability is expected to increase in a warmer climate, and the relationship between stability and perimeter length suggests that warming will increase cloud number and total perimeter.  But some work is required to reconcile this result with other thermodynamically-based arguments for changes in tropical cloud cover with warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has societal relevance given concerns regarding the severity of climate change and its impacts on people and the environment.  Clouds are perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty in efforts to determine the amount of warming produced by increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, and the relationships between fine-scale cloud properties and large-scale atmospheric conditions examined here could help to reduce this uncertainty.

To address this challenge, COME IN fosters discussions around the following questions: what are the unique needs and challenges that either facilitate or prevent students from underrepresented and under-resourced communities from pursuing a degree in COM science fields; which tools, methods and practices are most effective in terms of supporting the participation, persistence, and success of these students in COM fields; how does integration of traditional and local knowledge with western approaches of doing science contribute to the development of students\\u2019 identity as scientists; in what ways can professional societies, government and non-governmental organizations, businesses, and academia create more inclusive and safe working environments that foster students\\u2019 sense of belonging; what is the impact of long-term cohort building, professional development, and access to culturally-responsive mentors and role models on student retention and success; and lastly, what measures and metrics can be used to assess the effectiveness of mentorship and role models in COM science fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 1.8385226726531982, \"y\": 8.41229248046875}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"International Conference on Quantitative Ethnography\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project was submitted in response to EHR Core Research (ECR) program announcement NSF 19-508.

Critical thinking requires engineering students to make informed technical decisions that include diverse stakeholders and complex solutions. To achieve growth in their critical thinking, engineering students should also learn about ethics and professional responsibility. As research shows, engineering students need opportunities to practice the emotional infrastructure that\\u2019s required for engagement with myriad issues related to complex real-world solutions. The basic and foundational tenets of engineering require a commitment to professional ideals that elevate public health, safety, and the welfare of communities, while also acknowledging the complex interactions between social, environmental, and economic factors. This research project will focus on engineering ethics and professional responsibility by investigating the use of critical narratives as a teaching and learning tool in the professional formation of engineers. Critical narratives are structured, placed-based stories, intended to foster connections between the audience as well as specific cultures and communities. This research supports stated goals of the NSF Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) program by gathering empirical evidence related to engineering students\\u2019 critical thinking, ethics, and professional responsibility.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing an understanding of how engineering students perceive the broader impacts of their chosen profession, especially as articulated through the lens of ethics and professional responsibility, is an important first step in addressing professional formation. The current model of engineering education, focused primarily on technical proficiency, leaves little room for the structured and integrated exploration of these broader impacts. Therefore, this project\\u2019s goal is to improve critical thinking in undergraduate engineering students through a new educational intervention aimed at enhancing ethics and professional responsibility in undergraduate engineering students.

The continual development of mathematical tools to express many of the fundamental laws of nature has resulted in models with unparalleled predictive power. Mathematical models involve complex systems of equations expressing the physical processes of interest, and form the conceptual foundation of modern engineering and science. These equations exhibit all of the depth, difficulties, and subtleties of the physical systems being modeled, and sophisticated computational methodologies are required for their solution. This project focuses on the development of computational tools and software that engineers and scientists need to simulate problems arising in geology. One of the physical problems motivating this work is the need to model deep sea beds and permafrost regions where vast quantities of frozen methane, carbon dioxide, and other gases are trapped. These gases diffuse from deep within the earth and get trapped in permafrost, under glaciers, and in the cold depths of the deep ocean where they may freeze. Predicting the evolving state of these regions through geologic cycles and changes in climate is essential for environmental modeling. This project will develop and analyze computational tools and software required to model these regions where multiple fluids and gases undergo freezing, thawing, and dissolution as they flow. In addition to the technological developments, this project will also support the education and training of the next generation of scientists needed to sustain discovery and scientific leadership in these disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed centers around the development and analysis of computational tools needed to simulate flows in porous media containing multiple fluids, which may combine to form multiple phases and states (solid, liquid, gas). The thermodynamics of mixtures and phase changes is used to model the properties and states of the fluids at the pore scale, which appear constitutively in the macroscopic balance law of mass, momentum, and energy. This proposal focuses on the challenging problem of integrating pore scale and continuum models of these systems into a consistent framework where computational tools can be utilized to simulate these complex physical problems.  Convexity and homogeneity of the free energy (or concavity of entropy) enter these models in a subtle way, and are essential for proving stability of solutions. Numerical schemes will be developed that faithfully inherit these important attributes; in addition, convexity properties will be exploited to facilitate robust algorithms for the solution of the nonlinear systems that arise. Development of mathematical tools required to analyze the stability, robustness, convergence, and correctness of these algorithms will be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.480497360229492, \"y\": 9.3924560546875}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Was There a Shift Toward Small, Non-Fossilizing Plankton after the End of the Cretaceous Mass Extinction?\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Phytoplankton, which live in the surface ocean, produce organic matter from sunlight and carbon dioxide. This primary production forms the base of most marine food webs and is a critical part of the global carbon cycle. In the modern ocean plankton are being impacted by warming and ocean acidification. Natural changes in ocean temperature and chemistry in the geologic past can help us understand the long-term effects of stressors such as warming and acidification. The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event ~66 million years ago was one such time of global change. Calcareous (fossil-forming) nanoplankton were one of the dominant primary producers in the Cretaceous ocean. However, 93% of species of this group went extinct at the K-Pg boundary, and they were never again as dominant. Previous studies of the plankton response to the K-Pg event have generally been limited to studies of species which leave a physical fossil record. Thus, these studies provided only a partial view of ancient plankton ecosystems. The proposed work will overcome this limitation by using chemical fossils called biomarkers. These new data will be used together with traditional physical fossils to reconstruct changes in the marine plankton community following the K-Pg event. It has often been assumed that non-fossilizing phytoplankton filled the gap left by the decline in calcareous nannoplankton. This study will help test that hypothesis. Documenting the changes in both non-fossilizing and fossilizing plankton will improve our understanding of long-term changes in plankton ecology, and of how those changes could alter the ocean carbon cycle. This project will train early career researchers and undergraduate students, and will disseminate results to broader audiences through outreach and educational activities in partnership with organizations and programs in Austin, TX and Boulder, CO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop datasets of lipid biomarkers, calcareous nannoplankton, and planktic foraminifera from 5 sites in Tunisia, Spain, and the US Gulf Coast. Three sites in Tunisia (El Kef, Elles, and El Melah) represent a depth transect on a continental shelf (paleodepths of 200-500 m), Caravaca represents deeper water (~600-1000 m), while Brazos represent a shallow shelf which will allow us to test regional variability between north Africa and the US Gulf Coastal Plain. These data will allow tests of the following hypotheses:&lt;br/&gt;1. A low-diversity assemblage of non-fossilizing phytoplankton bloomed in the aftermath of the K-Pg extinction, during the time of low diversity calcareous nannoplankton \\u201cdisaster\\u201d assemblages.&lt;br/&gt;2. Subsequent recovery of calcareous nannoplankton diversity is associated with a decline in non-fossilizing phytoplankton.&lt;br/&gt;3. Shifts in the heterotrophic planktic foraminifera assemblages are tied to turnover in the whole autotrophic plankton assemblage.&lt;br/&gt;4. The post-extinction community of primary producers was dominated by smaller phytoplankton like algae and cyanobacteria, and would have increased carbon recycling in shallow waters and reduced carbon export to the deep sea.&lt;br/&gt;The study will improve our understanding of the recovery after the end Cretaceous mass extinction and in our overall understanding of the role of plankton ecology in marine ecosystem change. Additionally, reconstructing the whole plankton ecosystem, and not just the part that fossilizes, would represent a significant improvement of our toolkit to investigate ancient oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.697615146636963, \"y\": 5.4765143394470215}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"SBIR Phase II:  Development of An Allergen-Free Peanut Using Genome Editing Technology\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address health concerns associated with peanut allergies. Peanut allergies affect a large population and can be extremely dangerous for those with the most severe forms. Given the ubiquity of peanut products, peanut allergy is a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising incidence of this potentially fatal condition in children.  An allergen-free peanut developed from this project has the potential to significantly dampen the life-threatening reactions to peanuts, as well as the following benefits: (1) reducing the overall incidence of food allergy, (2) preserving human lives by eliminating anaphylaxis and death caused by accidental ingestion of peanut, (3) eliminating emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their families, (4) enhancing the public perception of peanuts as a health-promoting food, and (5) reducing the number of product recalls due to peanut contamination. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop and to commercialize an allergen-free peanut devoid of all clinically documented allergens using a genome-editing tool such as CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated system). Allergic reactions to peanut occur shortly after contact of peanut allergens with their specific IgE antibodies already bound to mast cells. The crosslinking of allergen specific IgE by the respective peanut allergens stimulates mast cells to release chemical mediators responsible for the clinical symptoms including sometime anaphylactic shock or death. Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are the most clinically documented peanut allergens. The objectives of the project are: (1) Construct and validate vectors for Ara h gene editing, transform peanut embryogenic callus and regenerate T0 peanut plants; (2) Identify T0 individuals with deletions in Ara h genes; (3) Assemble lines carrying homozygous deletions in all target Ara h genes; (5) Characterize the selected lines for Ara h mRNA and protein expression; (6) Assess vegetative development of Arah-free lines under greenhouse conditions.

The semiconductor industry, a key driver for the high-growth technology sector, is in the vanguard of this development. A large part of data-analytics practice in the semiconductor industry relies on workflows that involve human-in-the-loop steps to make an expert decision. How to automate those human-in-the-loop steps remains a fundamental challenge, and requires capturing the decision-making perception of an expert into software. This project will develop a set of novel methods and software tools that provide the capability for a domain expert to effectively model their perception in an analytics workflow. This capability enables automation of the workflow. Workflow automation not only enhances productivity but also reduces the chance of human error and, consequently, improves the overall quality of an operation. The experimental framework developed in the project will serve as an education platform for undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds. The platform will support training across multiple fields, including semiconductor production and test, machine learning, and software engineering. Such training provides a broader choice of career paths for students and prepares them with skills to meet future demands in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data analytics in the semiconductor industry largely involves prescriptive analytics, where analytics results are often used to support decision making that demands accountability. Today, there remains a substantial gap between what data-analytics and machine-learning technologies can provide and what is needed for automating a prescriptive analytics workflow. This project will fill the gap by developing a perception-based analytics software component which enables domain experts to model their perception into an automated workflow. The project addresses two fundamental challenges in such modeling. The first concerns the lack of sufficient data samples when training a model. The second concerns the requirements for robustness when using such a model. To address the first challenge, the project will pursue a novel approach that enables learning a model in one domain via learning a model in another domain that has sufficient data samples readily available for training. To address the second challenge, the project will provide an innovative approach enabling integration of multiple learning methods to achieve a required robustness level.

This team will measure magnetic field strengths in a sample of ~30,000 M-dwarfs that have been observed as part of the APOGEE (Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment) survey.

The response of an ecological system to environmental changes can shape the future of the goods and services associated with the ecosystem. Important examples include desertification and changes from high to low productivity regimes in fisheries, among others. Modeling the ecosystem state and predicting future shifts to other states requires the identification of measurable quantities that represent the state of the ecosystem. However, when the ecosystem shows spatial structure (for example, vegetation aggregates separated by bare soil, typical of semi-arid ecosystems), standard choices to represent the ecosystem state lead to erroneous predictions, unable to capture features shown by these systems across space and time. This project will combine concepts and techniques from mathematics and statistical physics to provide a novel theoretical framework able to describe reliably state shifts occurring in structured ecological systems. Such a framework will enable theoretical tools to diagnose ecosystem health and resilience as environmental conditions change and, therefore, facilitate preparedness, such as conservation strategies, against ecologically and economically costly shifts. Because aggregation occurs frequently in nature, the results of this project will be applicable to a wide variety of systems of socio-ecological importance (for instance, vegetation in ecosystems close to desertification). The project includes training through research involvement for junior researchers, to help develop the next generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transitions between different states of a focal ecosystem often can be described with a single order parameter (observable representing the state of the system) and a single control parameter (factor whose change triggers the transition). For a given value of the latter, the order parameter enables the calculation of the stability landscape, a manifold that reveals key information such as potential ecological states, their basins of attraction, and the possibility of alternative stable states. When an ecosystem shows spatial regularity, however, standard approaches yield misleading results: a system-averaged order parameter neglects the underlying spatial patterns, and using the spatially-explicit population density as order parameter produces a stability landscape that erroneously detects the empty space between population aggregates as signs of extinction (and possibility of alternative stable states) even for healthy ecosystems. This project aims to offer the first framework able to represent reliably, for any dynamical system that shows spatial regularity and undergoes a phase transition, the key interactions between population dynamics, formation of non-trivial spatial aggregates, and changes in resilience occurring around the transition. The investigator will use existing theoretical models to identify an associated transition and the main features affected by it and aims to combine them in a single order parameter able to describe holistically the transition. The project involves innovative combination and development of concepts and tools associated with statistical physics and bifurcation theory (e.g. stability and perturbative analyses, numerical renormalization, Fourier transforms), typically used independently in the study of phase transitions or pattern detection.

An improved understanding of these relationships revealed by this research will support development of more accurate and diverse models of spring plant growth stages. These models may then be able to predict which trees and shrubs will be favored in different regions with future environmental change, to the benefit of many types of societal planning.

This model provides a formal economic framework for analyzing arguments on several sides of the debate.  Rising female workforce participation and reduction in gender gaps in schooling and earnings are some of the most important changes in labor markets over the past few decades in high income countries.  While several competing parental leave policies have been proposed for the United States, there is not much research to guide which of the competing proposals will be best for the United States. In addition to studying the best parental policy for the US, the project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge economic research.  The results of this research project will provide guidance on how best to establish efficient parental leave policies for the US, thus improving the operations of the labor market.  It will also help to establish the US as a global leader in parental leave policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a large empirical literature on parental leave policies; however the evidence does not provide a unique verdict on the efficacy of these policies. On the one hand, these policies may foster gender equity and child development by enabling working mothers to combine careers and motherhood. On the other hand, these policies may have long-term negative consequences for women as they may inhibit women from building up their careers due to losses in work experience.   This project addresses the optimal design of parental leave policies and various ways of funding them by presenting a theory of how households make decisions regarding fertility, labor participation and the allocation of resources, how leave policies affect these decisions, and how profit-maximizing firms respond to these policies. The project provides a framework for the assessment of the optimality of paid family leave policies combining quasi-experimental policy variation with an explicit, structural modeling of the mechanisms through which female employees and their employers may respond to these interventions.  Unlike earlier research, this research considers statistical discrimination, household bargaining, and child development together in a general equilibrium model of the labor market. The semi-parametric, structural difference-in-difference approach of the project facilitates rigorous testing of the various mechanisms through which both sides of the market respond. The results of this research project will provide guidance on how best to establish parental leave policies, thus improving the operations of the labor market.

In the context of STEM learning, there is a strong need to engage both investigators and practitioners to create a research agenda that builds from an understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges presented by AI. Building on two recent invitational convenings in AI and education, the nonprofit Digital Promise will implement three online workshops to engage multiple communities in developing a future-oriented research agenda. The activities will build on recent research results from interdisciplinary conference proceedings (e.g., International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, International Conference of the Learning Sciences).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific activities will include three online workshops in STEM application areas, to include the role of AI with respect to: (1) learning and learning environments; (2) teacher learning and work; and (3) assessment. In the first part of each workshop, invited experts will provide an overview of current knowledge, expected advances, and important issues and barriers.  Using a structured interactive tool, attendees will extend and refine the presentation. In the second part of each workshop, attendees will work in breakout groups to envision what must happen in the next 3-5 years to strengthen applications of AI to education.

This conference focuses on addressing the shift in science towards big data and how Native American perspectives can be incorporated in the collection and analysis of the Earth system. Because the geosciences have some of the lowest rates of ethnic and racial diversity, crucial voices are often lost in the discussion of data-rich complex problems that impact human societies (for example, resource management and environmental stewardship). Data that is stripped of cultural identity produces results that are incomplete. The GA-5 conference is designed to be transformative by facilitating critical discussions regarding data science centered on Indigenous perspectives. Results from discussions and the dissemination of findings will initiate a critical dialog about open data practices and the rights of Native Americans to have control over how data collected on their land is handled and interpreted. Such discussions will result in changes reflective of the values of, and sensitivity to, Native American perspectives. The conference will be held at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, home to one of the largest Native American populations in the eastern United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geoscience Alliance (GA) is a national alliance of individuals committed to broadening participation of Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and people of Native Hawai\\u2019ian ancestry in the geosciences. The goals of the Geoscience Alliance are to: 1) create new collaborations that support geoscience education for Native American students, 2) establish a new research agenda that closes knowledge gaps about barriers and best practices related to Native American participation in the geosciences, 3) increase participation by Native Americans in setting the national geosciences research agenda, particularly on issues that impact Native lands, 4) communicate educational opportunities for Native American students in the geosciences, and 5) respect indigenous traditional knowledge. The GA-5 conference will promote knowledge-sharing on best practices for preparing all students to use data in the geosciences; support the academic and professional development of underrepresented minorities in geoscience disciplines; and provide participants with information about NSF-funded programs, internships, and undergraduate and graduate programs. Participants at the conference will be drawn from the geosciences, environmental and sustainability sciences, biology, engineering, mathematics and other related disciplines. Greater than 80% of participants will be from groups underrepresented in the geosciences with a focus on Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawai\\u2019ians and all participants will be encouraged to share current research in a poster session.

Hydrocarbons exist as isomers, which are compounds that have identical chemical formulas but different atomic arrangements and chemical properties. Hydrocarbon isomers must often be separated prior to their use as fuels or chemical feedstocks.  However, the molecular similarity of isomers complicates their separation, which is traditionally accomplished by energy-intensive distillation. The sustainability of these types of separations can be improved upon by including a membrane separation step in the process. Silica membranes can potentially provide rapid and selective transport of similarly sized hydrocarbon isomers. Silica tube or film membranes, however, are brittle and challenging to use at large scale. Inspired by the excellent flexibility of optical glass fine fibers, this project will develop silica hollow fine fiber membranes to provide both separation performance and scalability. The research will push the limits of high-performance silica and other inorganic membranes for hydrocarbon isomer separations and beyond. The ability to separate hydrocarbon isomers using a membrane-based approach will substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by the chemical and energy industries. Leveraging the lab\\u2019s unique accessibility to advanced membrane manufacturing, the education activities will broaden the participation of high school students from underrepresented groups in membrane and sustainable separations research. At the core of the educational activities is a distance outreach program that provides hands-on science experiences to local high school students with limited school access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to create scalable silica membranes with tunable butane isomer transport properties using novel polymer-templated inorganic hollow fine fiber substrates inexpensively made at moderate temperatures. Ultramicroporous silica films will be made for structural and transport characterizations. Inorganic hollow fine fiber substrates will be derived from polymer hollow fiber templates. Silica hollow fine fiber membranes will be formed by a novel sacrificial layer approach. Kinetic adsorption measurements will complement membrane permeation studies to link membrane transport properties with silica ultramicropore structures. The research activities will advance the understanding of (i) the structure-property relationships between organoalkoxysilane chemistry and ultramicroporous silica transport properties; (ii) the role of entropic diffusion selectivities in molecular differentiation by ultramicroporous silica; (iii) the formation mechanism of scalable polymer-templated inorganic hollow fine fiber substrates; (iv) the key components required to fabricate silica hollow fine fiber membranes by the sacrificial layer approach.

Unfortunately, the prolonged life of these ultra-low-power systems poses a fundamentally new problem. While the devices last for years, programs that run on them become obsolete when the nature of sensory input or the operating conditions change.  The effect of continued execution of such an obsolete program can be catastrophic. For example, if a cardiac pacemaker fails to recognize an impending cardiac arrest because the patient has aged or their physiology has changed, these devices will cause more harm than any good. Hence, being able to react, adapt, and evolve is necessary for these systems to guarantee their accuracy and response time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at devising algorithms, tools, systems, and applications that will enable ultra-low-power, sensor-enabled, computing devices capable of executing complex machine learning algorithms while being powered solely by harvesting energy. Unlike common practices where a fixed classifier runs on a device, this project takes a fundamentally different approach where a classifier is constructed in a manner that it can adapt and evolve as the sensory input to the system, or the application-specific requirements, such as the time, energy, and memory constraints of the system, change during the extended lifetime of the system. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed systems, several application-specific, battery-less systems will be developed and deployed, which includes \\u2013 (1) a personalized air quality index predictor for asthmatic individuals, (2) an ultra-low-power voice assistant that gives voice to everyday objects, and (3) a real-time tracker for shared resources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will enable smarter and more intelligent microbots and autonomous systems that will help improve healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and the environment. Outcomes of this research bear the potential to transform healthcare through the development of batteryless medical implants and wearable devices that will be able to monitor and learn person-specific physiologic parameters and thus be able to detect anomalies at their onset, which could be the cause of developing the disease.

This work aims to ensure that their voices are heard and reflected in policy change impacting their career trajectories. This project will utilize a holistic approach to gathering data from URM engineering faculty, especially women, from a variety of institution types, (e.g. Hispanic Serving Institutions, Predominately White Institutions, and Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities).

This research will reveal how interim and/or new policies and practices during and after a crisis can impact the career trajectories of URM engineering faculty.

Topology is the study of spatial structures (e.g. the surface of a donut, the large-scale shape of the cosmos, a tangled strand of DNA, a cluster of points in a massive data set), while algebraic geometry studies the mathematics of the ubiquitous polynomial equation. These disciplines have many and diverse points of contact; the principal investigator will study one in particular: families of Riemann surfaces. A surface is a topological object like the two-dimensional surface of a coffee cup, possibly one with lots of extra handles. A Riemann surface gives a special way of describing such an object as the solution to a polynomial equation, much as we learn in high school algebra that some equations describe circles, others ellipses, and others far more complicated shapes. A family of Riemann surfaces arises by varying the equations used to define the Riemann surface - one can imagine \\\"turning a knob\\\" to stretch and distort the shapes of the surfaces. Families of Riemann surfaces arise in many parts of mathematics and also play an important role in theoretical physics. The principal investigator will apply tools from topology and the related discipline of geometric group theory in order to better understand some of the most important families of Riemann surfaces that mathematicians today are interested in. Broader impacts include the establishment of a new chapter of the national Directed Reading Project network.<br/><br/>The project has two components. The first will investigate the topology of strata of Abelian differentials (translation surfaces). These families have been intensively studied by dynamicists and geometers, but there are foundational topological questions that still remain. In particular, the (orbifold) fundamental groups of strata are still highly mysterious. This can be effectively probed by way of the monodromy representation, a map into the mapping class group. The principal investigator will continue his work describing these monodromy representations, and will develop new tools to understand the monodromy kernel and so further develop the theory of fundamental groups of strata. Central to this endeavor will be an elucidation of the precise relationship between Artin groups and fundamental groups of strata. The second component of this project concerns families constructed via branched covers. These families have served as an important source of examples in topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory. The principal investigator will investigate the monodromy of these families with the objective of further synthesizing the topological aspects (braid groups, mapping class groups) with the algebraic (arithmetic groups and generalizations, Burau-like representations, primitive homology).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.138655185699463, \"y\": 9.866190910339355}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Topics in Mathematical Biology and Fluid Mechanics\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project focuses on several aspects of mathematical biology and fluid mechanics. Many critical biological phenomena involve fluid-cell interaction or fluid-like behaviors. For example, fertilization of marine animal eggs relies on the transportation of the ambient fluid stream and sardines form large fluid-like swarms to evade predators. The project's principal focus is to develop novel mathematical tools to analyze the various fluid-related or fluid-like effects in these biological phenomena. There are three main topics in this project. The first topic concerns the interaction between the fluid flow and biological phenomena, which is motivated by two experiments in marine animal fertilization and cell embryology. In the first experiment researchers observed optimal fluid speed to maximize the fertilization rate of abalone. The second experiment confirms that the cellular flow helps organ formation at the early stages of the embryos of Drosophila. Fluid mixing effect and fast-spreading effect play important roles in the analysis. These two effects introduce another 'fast diffusion time scale' into the biological system and significantly change the long-time behavior. The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop new mathematical tools that capture the interplay between these fluid phenomena and the biology involved.  The project will provide research training experience for undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modified hypocoercivity functional, which was applied in the paper by J. Bedrossian and the PI, and detailed spectral analysis, are crucial to derive the 'fast diffusion time scale' in the nonlinear setting. Applying these tools to the biologically relevant models provides deeper understandings of the experiments. The second topic covers the single and multi-species hydrodynamic models of flocking behavior. In these models, the flock of agents converges to a limiting structural state through sharing information among individuals. However, if the agents only share information with their direct neighbors, the flock's limiting behavior is highly nontrivial. The PI plans to develop new tools and bring ideas from spectral graph theory and random graph theory to analyze it. The third topic concerns the growth/blow-up mechanism in fluid mechanics. The PI will study two non-local models related to the generation of small-scale blowup in the fluid motivated by the singular Hou-Luo scenario for the 3D-Euler equation.

In the meantime, there are many interesting related questions that may serve as research projects for the training of graduate students interested in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study problems in two specific directions. First, the PI would like to study collapsing of Calabi-Yau metrics, and connections with algebraic geometry and moduli compactification. Previous work of the PI and collaborators has  yielded a satisfactory description in the case of minimal degenerations and the PI proposes to study the more general situation. This requires exploiting the existing techniques from collapsing theory, and further developing those. Secondly, the PI will study singularity analysis for Yang-Mills instantons.

Those so called \\u201cdark taxa\\u201d will be described by using single-cell genomics of environmental samples, in parallel with culturing techniques to isolate rare or slow-growing microbes. Their functional roles will also be elucidated using RNA transcript sequencing. Finally, using whole genomes, this project will generate a new class-level phylogenetic framework.

Thermal emission from bulk materials is typically broadband and largely diffuse. However, significant development has been made lately to construct directional-selective and wavelength-dependent emitters and absorbers using micro/nanostructured materials. The polarization state of an electromagnetic wave is determined based on how its electric field varies as the wave propagates. It is well known that polarized light detection has important applications in space and atmospheric remote sensing, target detection, surface characterization, and biomedical diagnostics. However, the polarization effect in thermal radiation has not been extensively examined. This combined theoretical and experimental project aims to model, design, fabricate, and characterize micro/nanostructured material surfaces with unique polarization-dependent thermal radiation. The study will enable a fundamental understanding of the nature of thermal emission in terms of the state and degree of polarization. The knowledge obtained will potentially benefit applications ranging from energy harvesting and surface imaging, to object recognition and biomedical sensing. Significant efforts will also be devoted to advancing student-centered pedagogy and expanding international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metamaterials made of thin nanostructured layers, or metasurfaces, hold promise for controlling the polarization state of thermal emission. This project will employ the finite-difference time-domain method and the matrix formulation to model the reflection and absorption of metasurfaces, considering both linearly and circularly polarized incidence. Emphasis will be given to circularly polarized emitters using plasmonic metamaterials with asymmetric metallic micro/nanostructures. The localized fields will be analyzed for both linearly and circularly polarized incident waves to explore the resonance mechanisms and plasmonic local heating at the micro/nanoscales. Furthermore, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem will be employed to directly model the field components and their correlations using anisotropic dyadic Green\\u2019s functions. Both the direct and indirect methods will be used to predict the emittance components defined based on Stokes\\u2019 parameters. The results will be compared with the measured infrared reflectance and emittance of fabricated plasmonic metasurfaces. In the emittance measurements, combined retarder and polarizer arrangements will enable a characterization of all of Stokes\\u2019 parameters.

Asymmetric Propulsion uses a single-bladed propeller to both move and steer an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In addition to eliminating the need for control fins, reducing cost and complexity, and increasing efficiency, it can also allow AUVs to hold station over objects of interest. This capability has numerous scientific, military, and commercial applications because it allows the same robot to perform large-area surveys and then hold station over specific objects and perform close-up inspections. Such missions currently require multiple specialized robots and supervision from a support ship. Providing these dual capabilities in a single AUV will enable surveys without a ship, reduce costs and energy, and increase the rate and resolution of ocean studies.  The focus of this Phase I project is improving control of Asymmetric Propulsion for holding station relative to an object of interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop and test control algorithms that preserve roll stability when Asymmetric Propulsion is used to turn and maneuver torpedo-shaped AUVs. Using a single motor with an asymmetric propeller to both move and steer an AUV is mechanically simpler but computationally more complex. Holding station relative to an object by actuating a single degree of freedom is a nontrivial under-constrained control and navigation problem. This problem has numerous applications in marine, terrestrial, and aerial robotics.  A simplifying approach is to implement a library of scripted behaviors that can be selectively executed based on position input from visual sensors. These behaviors will independently be constructed to reduce the sudden torques that induce roll in torpedo-shaped AUVs. This approach will lead to a successful demonstration of stable maneuverability using a surface test platform that is free to move in roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.884475231170654, \"y\": 7.68378210067749}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Determination of sputtering and desorption cross sections for metal species relevant to the exosphere of Mercury &amp; other airless bodies: Laboratory measurements\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The surface of Mercury is covered by a rocky crust made up mostly of silicate minerals, and daytime temperatures are significantly warmer than those found on Earth.

They are excited in the atmosphere when winds flow over mountains, by thunderstorms and other strong convective systems, and when winter storms intensify.  Gravity waves play an important role in the momentum and energy balance of the atmosphere, with direct impacts on surface weather and climate through their effect on the variability of key features of the climate system such as the jet streams and stratospheric polar vortices.  These waves present a challenge to weather and climate prediction: waves on scales of 100 meters to 100 kilometers can neither be systematically measured with conventional observational systems, nor properly resolved in global atmospheric models. As a result, these waves must be represented, or approximated, based on the resolved flow that can be directly simulated. Current representations of gravity waves are severely limited by computational necessity and the scarcity of observations, leading to inaccuracies or uncertainties in short term weather and long term climate predictions. The objective of this project is to leverage unprecedented observations from Loon high altitude balloons and use specialized high resolution computer simulations and machine learning techniques to develop accurate, data-informed representation of gravity waves. The outcomes of this project are expected to result in better weather and climate models, thus improving short term forecasts of weather extremes and long term climate change projections, which have substantial societal benefits. Furthermore, the project will support the training of 3 Ph.D. students, 4 postdocs, and 10 undergraduate summer researchers to work at the intersection of atmospheric dynamics, climate modeling, and data science, thus preparing the next generation of scientists for interdisciplinary careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will deliver two key advances. First, it will open up a new data source to constrain gravity wave momentum transport in the atmosphere. Loon LLC has been launching super pressure balloons since 2013 to provide global internet coverage. Very high resolution position, temperature, and pressure observations (taken every 60 seconds) are available from thousands of flights. This provides an unprecedented source of high resolution observations to constrain gravity wave sources and propagation. The project will process the balloon measurements and, in concert with novel high resolution simulations, establish a publicly available dataset to open up a potentially transformational resource for observationally constrained assessment of gravity wave sources, propagation, and breaking. The second transformation will be using machine learning techniques to develop computationally feasible representations of momentum deposition by gravity waves. Current physics-based representations only account for vertical propagation of the waves (i.e., they are one dimensional) and ignore their horizontal propagation. Using the data based on the Loon measurements and high resolution models, one and three dimensional data driven representations will be developed to more accurately and efficiently represent the effects of gravity waves in weather and climate models. These novel representations will be implemented in idealized atmospheric models to study the role of gravity waves in the variability of the extratropical jet streams, the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (a slow variation of the winds in the tropical stratosphere) and the polar vortex of the winter stratosphere, enabling better understanding their response to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.525110244750977, \"y\": 7.257087707519531}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: DigIn: Documenting marine biodiversity through Digitization of Invertebrate collections\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"For two centuries, America has amassed an unparalleled collection of specimens from exploring the world's oceans. They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale.

However, the ways that microbes are transported from one environment to another are not well understood. Each year, wildland fires emit millions of tons of smoke particles into the atmosphere and these particles likely carry microbes with them. Traditionally, wildfires have been studied in terms of direct impacts to terrestrial biota and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, but the role of smoke as an agent of biological dispersal has yet to be explored. Grasslands are one of the most widespread and frequently burned ecosystems, so this research will examine the impacts of smoke-driven microbial dispersal in tallgrass prairies of the central United States using unmanned aerial vehicles flying into smoke plumes, combustion experiments and soil incubations that mimic conditions in nature. This project uses an integrated approach to better understand the consequences of smoke to human, plant, and animal health across all environments where wildland fire occurs. The increasing size and severity of global wildfires, leading to increased interaction between biomass burning smoke and human populations, make this research relevant to a wide range of stakeholders including those interested in the potential transport of pathogenic microbes. In addition to mentoring three post-doctoral scholars, a graduate student, and undergraduate summer interns, the results will be disseminated to local communities through existing K-12 and informal learning programs at the Konza Prairie LTER and NEON sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbial emissions in smoke from biomass burning are both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the bioaerosols observed from wind-driven emissions, implying that wildland fire may be a globally relevant and yet-unquantified mechanism for microbial teleconnections among ecosystems. To test how smoke drives microbial metacommunity ecology, this project will use an integrated approach that compares the composition and viability of smoke source and sink microbial assemblages in field- and laboratory-based experiments. Smoke and particulate deposition during repeated prescribed fires in grasslands will be sampled over two years to characterize the relationships among fire behavior, meteorological conditions, and survival of microbes transported in smoke. Sterilized and untreated soils from similar, unburned sites will be exposed to contrasting dosages of smoke with known microbial content to compare the relative influence of selection, dispersal, and drift on soil microbial community assembly. These data will be used to build new capacity for simulating smoke microbial dispersal across scales by parameterizing microbial emission fluxes and microbial dispersion in atmospheric, chemical transport, and coupled fire-atmosphere models. Results will lend insight into the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic processes in driving microbial community ecology in systems where fire disturbances are frequent, while modeling will enable predictions of the scale and impact of smoke-related microbial dispersal.

Many volcanoes around the world erupt on a regular basis, sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes every few days or weeks. Most eruptions at frequently active volcanoes are relatively mild by volcanic standards, but they tend to vary surprisingly in explosivity and duration and this variability makes it difficult to reliably assess when and where they might pose a threat to human life or property. The goal of this proposal is to better understand what happens inside frequently active volcanoes prior to eruption and why different types of eruptions can occur. This research approaches these questions by developing mathematical model that can be tested against existing observational data from samples erupted at these volcanoes. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently identified the development of these kinds of models as one of the three grand challenges in modern volcanology and our proposals aims to tackle this challenge. By doing so, the researchers will enlarge the toolbox available in modern volcanology. To extend the reach of our research to K-12 classroom, they will participate in an existing professional development program for high-school teachers. Given that the research probes forces and waves in the context of volcanic systems, the work is ideally suited for integration into the physics curriculum at the high-school level, which is aimed at understanding cause and effect in system models.

While the primary focus is on basaltic volcanoes like Hawaii, U.S., and Stromboli, Italy, volcano, the work is also relevant for persistently degassing volcanoes with more silicic compositions like Mount Erebus, Antarctica, and Karymsky Volcano, Kamchatka. Our proposal integrates two existing model approaches, (1) the exchange flow model focused on understanding the long-term stability of persistently active volcanoes and (2) the slug model that prioritizes understanding short-term eruptive behavior.

The mission of the principal investigator's laboratory is to understand neural computations underlying behavior at multiple timescales as they apply to a given task using novel techniques such as creating mathematical models of behavior and developing new methods for probing neural activity as it relates to behavior.  The proposed research also has an important educational mission:  Most problems in the world require interdisciplinary thinking, which is best taught at an early age.  In this project, high school students are directly involved in the investigator's multidisciplinary research program, with the goals of (1) deepening the students' neuroscience education with a focus on engineering, mathematics, and technology, (2) exposing them to interdisciplinary training at a younger and more receptive age, and (3) preparing them well to think holistically about complex scientific problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching objective of the principal investigator's research is to understand how sensorimotor transformation unfolds in the brain during the performance of complex behaviors that are part of an animal's natural behavioral repertoire.  The gap in understanding of this process exists because attacking this problem requires an integrated, multidisciplinary approach that combines neuroscience techniques, animal behavior, and computational skills- a combination not often found in one investigator.

The project tests this hypothesis in the context of odor-guided locomotion, a complex flexible behavior, in a relatively simple and genetically highly tractable model system, Drosophila.

The aims of the proposal are twofold. First, to use cutting-edge statistical models to uncover the factors that most affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mortality rates. Second, to provide decisions makers with a simple-to-use, extensive instruction supported, data and scenario analysis (DASA) platform for evaluating the implications of different policy measures, including the implementation and relaxation of social distancing behavior, surveillance, contact tracing, patient isolation, and vaccination (once suitable vaccines are available).

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Woodland salamanders can have different color patterns (color polymorphisms) in the same populations. Color types (morphs) are not simply different colors, they also vary in behavior, body form, and ecology. Long-term persistence of multiple color morphs remains an evolutionary puzzle, as previous studies have suggested that selection should either lead to one color morph dominating or formation of separate differently colored species. The aim of this project is to examine the evolution of a striped/unstriped color polymorphism in woodland salamanders using data collected from several U.S. natural history museums. Archived tissue samples will be used to understand the evolutionary relationships of salamanders. The fellow will also take digital images of polymorphic salamanders using high-throughput approaches, which will subsequently be identified as striped or unstriped by community scientists, and through machine learning approaches. The fellowship will facilitate mentorship training and foster opportunities for undergraduates who are interested in research. The fellow will collaborate with local high schools and participate in outreach events to share the results of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the genus Plethodon, a striped/unstriped color pattern polymorphism has either independently originated 10 times or has been lost in 14 species that are fixed for a single morph. Extensive research on one polymorphic species (P. cinereus) suggests that the color morphs are associated with distinct sets of morphological and ecological traits. Thus, this system presents an ideal opportunity to test: 1) the origin and evolution of the polymorphism; 2) climatic niche overlap between morphs and species with divergent phenotypes; 3) whether there are non-random patterns of co-adapted trait complexes that evolved in Plethodon; and 4) how quickly those traits respond to fluctuating environmental conditions, including rapid environmental changes in the present. Using phylogenetic comparative approaches, the fellow will assess the relationship between intra-specific patterns and macroevolutionary outcomes within Plethodon, which represents a critical next step in understanding the evolution of this widespread polymorphism. This work is enabled by an interdisciplinary approach to use biological collections, while leveraging machine learning, and citizen scientist efforts. The end results will provide essential new knowledge about the evolution of color morphs and the relationship between polymorphism and diversity.

A high percentage of software costs are consumed by efforts to find and fix software defects. It is now common to apply defect-finding techniques continuously throughout development and operation of software systems, reviewing every code change (Modern Code Review, abbreviated MCR) and testing the software for defects continuously (Continuous Integration, abbreviated CI). Unfortunately, these continuous defect-finding efforts incur high cost for software developers, and they provide limited success. The goal of this project is to reduce the unfruitful, manual effort that software developers spend on code reviews and continuous integration, while keeping as many of their fruitful tasks as possible. To achieve this goal, this project will develop techniques to automatically prioritize review and integration actions, giving higher priority to those that are more likely to find defects. This project will advance the understanding of what software changes are risky, which ones are better accepted by developers, and what makes developers trust automatically-targeted defect-finding techniques. It will also produce many techniques and tools to enable software engineers to find more software defects in less time. This project will benefit society by improving software reliability, as well as reducing its cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will conduct interviews to survey software engineers to understand the human factors that would impact the adoption of automated targeted MCR and CI techniques.

Such three-dimensional analysis is particularly important for developing materials processing strategies for additive manufacturing and for understanding mechanisms leading to material degradation and failure.  In addition, the nanopatterning capabilities of the instrument provide precision engineering of novel nanometer-scale optical and mechanical devices. The location of the instrument within the Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network, a node of the NSF National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), provides enhanced access to researchers from across the nation, impacting local universities, not-for-profit institutions and industries.

There is an urgent need for better tools to monitor the transmission of SARS-CoV2. Surface sampling of community surfaces holds promise as a tool to identify how transmission is occurring. While most studies are focused on SARS-CoV2 in hospitals and other clinical settings, this project will focus on monitoring SARS-CoV2 on surfaces in community settings. This will be achieved by tracking SARS-CoV2 on crosswalk buttons, doors, grocery cart handles, gas pump handles, ATM interfaces, and other surfaces that are most likely to be contaminated. Results will be assessed to determine whether surface sampling can be used to rapidly and cost-effectively gauge the effectiveness of outbreak control measures. If successful, this research will allow the prioritization of surfaces for disinfection during the SARS-CoV2 outbreak. Combining the results with environmental modeling will help identify the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection in public spaces during the epidemic and once intervention efforts are relaxed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SARS-CoV2 transmission has been more difficult to control than previous outbreaks of human coronaviruses. This is thought to result from the high proportion of asymptomatic cases (up to 60%) actively shedding the virus. Infected community members can shed SARS-CoV2 onto surfaces up to a week before developing serious symptoms and can continue shedding the virus during and after disease progression. Recent evidence suggests viable SARS-CoV2 particles can survive on stainless steel and plastic surfaces for up to three days. The goal of this project is to better understand environmental transmission of SARS-CoV2 through contact with contaminated surfaces. This will be achieved through the following specific objectives: 1) Characterize the presence and concentration of SARS-CoV2 over time on high touch fomites in public locations during an outbreak; 2) Determine whether the presence or concentration of SARS-CoV2 on fomites over time is associated with public health control measures and changes in community infection rate; 3) Use SARS-CoV2 concentration data generated in this study in conjunction with transmission efficiency of viral particles to determine risk of infection from fomites. Given that more than half of infections may be asymptomatic, any recurrence may not be detected through typical hospital-based surveillance until transmission is already widespread in the community. Results will be used to assess whether changes in outbreak control strategies over the study period impact environmental concentrations of SARS-CoV2. A major concern is that lifting control measures too rapidly or ineffectively could cause a rapid increase in new infections.

The connection to local industries will bridge the gap currently existing in the high school curriculum allowing the students to be exposed, through their teachers' experience, to real applications of science and engineering. Within the scope of the summer research activities, teachers will have the opportunity to work in SJSU engineering labs along with SJSU engineering faculty and their graduate students on research projects designed specifically for them. The research projects touch upon concepts in biology, chemistry, physics, and computer electronics ensuring wide applicability to K-12 curricula and compatibility with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The teachers will also develop curricular units, hands-on experimental modules and curriculum development activities that will be incorporated in their classrooms during the following school year. Teachers will receive support for the development of the curricular modules during one-on-one and group weekly sessions, over the summer, with a SJSU Teacher/Science Education faculty. The program will be supported by weekly seminars from industry and academic professionals and group activities such as field trips to local, Silicon Valley, companies.

The goal of this research project is to quantify the value of these free products together with the increased price competition for consumers, and compute welfare gains. The research incorporates differences in labor skill and consumer income levels. The project has broad policy implications for understanding the role of digital advertising in the economy for consumers with different socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores how digital advertising affects macroeconomic aggregates. The project builds on a variant of advertising model. The model allows for both traditional and digital advertising, the provision of free media goods, and differences in incomes across consumers. The project incorporates the complementarity between digital goods and leisure and distinguishes between skilled and unskilled labor. The developed model will be calibrated and simulated to match stylized facts for the U.S. economy. The welfare gain arising from digital advertising will be computed.

This project examines the role of internal migration in the spread of education, using novel historical data that covers many aspects of American economic and social life before and after the Civil War.  The information recorded in the dataset includes the value of the taxed property and the amounts of tax revenue raised the number of public and private schools, teachers, and pupils in those schools; their finances by revenue source; the number of libraries and newspapers printed; and the prevailing wages paid to different kinds of labor. Utilizing this data, the project considers potential mechanisms to understand how internal migration affected local schooling choices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores how migration from more educated states affect school enrollment rates for the local population. The project builds on the notion that inequality in school enrollments can be explained by the origins of migrants who chose to live in a given county. Accordingly, internal migration was an important channel in the spread of schools in the US. Using detailed historical data, the project examines specific channels through which migrants from more educated states improved the schooling outcomes of the locals. The project particularly focuses on the funding of schools through property taxes to consider that migrants from states with functioning public systems can be instrumental for more public funding for schools in their destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 1.7763636112213135, \"y\": 7.97156286239624}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: Spatial Awareness for Machine Perception\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"For many applications in health, security, and robotics, the capability for computers to track objects in video is critical.

Although tidewater glaciers make up a small percent of all the glaciers in the world, they are important for climate because they contain large volumes of ice and because they can change rapidly. Our ability to predict future sea level rise depends on how well we understand these glaciers. Most tidewater glaciers are currently retreating. Until recently, one of the few tidewater glaciers that was advancing was the Taku Glacier in Southeast Alaska. Photos and satellite imagery indicate that the glacier has recently started to retreat, but it is unknown how quickly the glacier will retreat. This project will investigate the early stages of the glacier\\u2019s retreat by using time-lapse photography, drone surveys, satellite data, and computer models. The project is expected to lead to a better understanding of tidewater glacier retreat and improve our ability to predict sea level rise. The project will support early career researchers and students, who will also be involved in a field course at the glacier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tidewater glaciers are known to undergo cycles of slow, centennial-scale advance and rapid, decadal-scale retreat that are driven by processes occurring at the glacier-ocean interface, including iceberg calving, submarine melting, and sediment deposition and erosion. These cycles can occur in a steady climate, but climate can modify the timescales of advance and retreat as well as act as a trigger. Since the advance phase is longer than the retreat phase, in a steady climate one would expect the majority of tidewater glaciers to be advancing. This is not the case at present, as the majority of tidewater glaciers around the world are retreating or in a quasi-stable configuration. Until recently, Taku Glacier in Southeast Alaska was one of the rare advancing tidewater glaciers. Recent observations indicate that, due to a warming climate, the glacier is now thinning over its entire area and has begun to retreat off of the terminal moraine that it developed and prograded over the past 125 years. This project will investigate the processes by which a tidewater glacier transitions into retreat, and the evolving glacier sensitivity to climate during this transition, by integrating field and remote sensing observations of Taku Glacier with numerical modeling experiments. By advancing understanding of tidewater glacier stability, the project will lead to improved estimates of sea level rise.

B. subtilis is a soil-dwelling microbe used to stimulate plant growth and to improve intestinal health in animals and humans. B. subtilis is also a model system for studying cell shape and division. The cellular machinery that orchestrates cell elongation and division include numerous components, several of which are poorly understood, and for which there are few tools to carefully control their abundance. This project aims to modify B. subtilis such that the abundance of target proteins is controlled by the concentration of non-standard amino acid supplied in the culture media. An analogy for this project is the construction of a dimmer switch for a light in a room. The new switch allows one to dim the brightness of a light that must stay on, where previously the only option was to increase brightness relative to the default setting. If one can dim the light in a room, then it is possible that one will see new features in the room and understand how little light is needed to keep the room functional. In addition to this research, undergraduate students who participate in the nascent International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team at the University of Delaware will receive lab space and mentoring to conduct projects related to non-standard amino acids.

Upon achievement of non-standard amino acid incorporation in B. subtilis, the project will investigate the ability to titrate extracellular amino acid concentration and achieve dose-dependent translation of a model fluorescent protein. This project then aims to use this new control strategy to interrogate cell wall synthesis and to explore the extension of synthetic auxotrophy. Cell morphology and length will be studied as components of the cell wall synthesis machinery are titrated, shedding light on what protein concentrations are required to achieve normal cell shapes. Synthetic auxotrophy is a promising intrinsic biological containment technique where an organism is engineered to depend on a synthetic nutrient for its growth.

These first responders can keep a person who is struggling to breathe alive until they arrive at a hospital and receive sustained care, including support from a respiratory ventilator if necessary.  This project focuses on paramedics, who have the highest level of training in pre-hospital care.  In addition to utilizing airway devices that support breathing, paramedics can revive a heart attack victim, deliver a baby who cannot wait for his/her mother to get to the hospital, administer medications, and perform other life-sustaining procedures.  Unfortunately, there is a critical shortage of paramedics in many parts of the US, which is partly due to student failure from paramedic training programs, or inability to pass state and national certification exams.  This project will develop a handheld tablet device that will allow small groups of paramedic students to get extra practice in performing pre-hospital care procedures on patient manikins.  These supplemental practice sessions will be entirely student-run.  Students will download scripted emergency scenarios from their course web site.  One student will play the role of lead paramedic, another student will play the role of an EMT who assists the paramedic, while a third student will use the tablet to check off actions (e.g., Checked blood pressure) and to report the results of these actions (e.g., Blood pressure is 80/50).  All actions will be recorded in a log that will produce an automated debriefing; that is, feedback on student performance during the scenario.   Increased opportunities for students to practice skills during training could raise pass rates from paramedic programs and on certification exams.  Better-prepared paramedics will also increase patient safety.

Although meta-reviews of SBT indicate that debriefing may be its most critical component, there is a dearth of research to guide debriefing practice.  This project will help to fill this void.  The research team will implement and compare the effectiveness of three approaches to automated debriefing.  One version will replicate the current state-of-the-art in automated debriefing, whereby students scroll through an event log with embedded textual feedback on their actions during the scenario.  This approach to debriefing does not follow a standardized protocol (script) for debriefing.  The second version follows a debriefing protocol whose acronym is DEBRIEF (for Define the debriefing rules; Explain the learning objectives; specify the performance Benchmarks; Review what was supposed to happen; Identify what actually happened; Examine why; and Formalize the take home points).  This version of automated debriefing simulates student self-guided debriefing.   The system will prompt the student to go through the DEBRIEF protocol steps but will not provide feedback.  The third version will simulate human facilitated debriefing.  Two automated agents, a facilitator and a peer, will support the student who played the role of lead paramedic during a practice scenario in carrying out a productive debriefing, according to DEBRIEF.  The main technological innovation will be development of methods to manage the interaction between these simulated agents (facilitator and peer) and the human paramedic student.  The project consists of three main phases.  First, to inform implementation of the agent facilitated debriefing system, the research team will observe and video record actual SBT scenarios and debriefings that take place during paramedic training at the University of Pittsburgh, Center for Emergency Medicine.  Second, the researchers will iteratively develop, field test, and refine each version of the debriefing system.  Third, the researchers will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the potential of these approaches to automated debriefing to improve psychomotor skills (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and decision-making skills.  Study findings might generalize to simulation-based training of other healthcare professionals and to any field in which debriefing plays a major role in training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.375143527984619, \"y\": 7.132340908050537}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"WOU-MMA: Improved Data Access for GW Astronomy\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \\\"Windows on the Universe\\\" Big Idea. Gravitational-wave astronomy is one of the most rapidly evolving fields in astrophysics.  Over the past few years, the interferometer gravitational-wave observatories LIGO and Virgo have begun to record compact object mergers of black holes and neutron stars for the first time.  These discoveries are having a tremendous impact on our ability to study the population of black holes in our universe, learn about fundamental particle physics through study of the dense interiors of neutron stars, test general relativity as never before, and investigate a range of other topics.  Data from these cutting edge instruments are made available to the scientific community and the public  through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC) at gw-openscience.org.  As LIGO and Virgo become more sensitive, the rate of discoveries is quickly accelerating.  Starting in 2015, the number of observed compact object mergers has grown from 1, to 10, to 50.  During the last observing run, LIGO and Virgo were observing mergers of black holes or neutron stars about once per week, and future upgrades are expected to make this rate grow.  As we begin to record hundreds or thousands of these astrophysical events, the scientific community will need a new set of tools to access and analyze the information associated with these discoveries.  This project will fund the construction of a new \\u201cevent portal\\u201d, which will allow scientists, teachers, students,  and enthusiasts around the world to browse catalogs of compact object mergers, study measurements of black hole properties, view graphics and plots, and listen to data converted to audio files, as well as download and analyze the associated interferometer data.  The award also includes funding to host an Open Data Workshop to train students and scientists who wish to contribute to this new field of astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large collections of gravitational-wave events will invite a wide set of scientific investigations, but only if researchers with diverse interests are able to access and explore the associated data. Current structures on the GWOSC website provide only minimal support for derived data products (e.g., source parameters), and will not scale to hundreds of events. Going forward, the set of researchers interested in gravitational-wave science will likely broaden substantially to include more people interested in stellar populations, general relativity, nuclear astrophysics, and other fields. Many of these same people will be highly interested in derived data products, in addition to the gravitational-wave strain data GWOSC already hosts. Developing the event portal will enable these researchers to find and understand the data they need, and empower them to carry through their investigations.

Braunschweig of the Research Foundation CUNY - Advanced Science Research Center are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop an understanding of methods whereby molecular assemblies can be built on extended and nanostructured metal surfaces to exhibit predictable properties.  Molecular assemblies built with precise nanoscale geometries on surfaces are designed to trap and transport charge and energy in directable ways.  Advanced imaging and optical techniques are used to examine the resulting structures and to determine how the structures control the movement of electrons through the molecules or how they exchange energy with the surfaces on which they are deposited.  The project advances the development improved light harvesting and solar energy conversion, portable chemical sensing, and quantum computing.  In the course of this research, graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students from diverse backgrounds are prepared to join the advanced electronics workforce.  They are trained in cross-cutting research at the intersection of chemical synthesis, materials chemistry, and surface science in a coordinated collaborative environment between the laboratories of the principle investigators.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Designing molecular assemblies that can trap and transport charge, and exchange energy in predictable and directable ways via efficient electronic coupling, is critical for enabling the design of devices ranging from novel sensors to molecular/organic based electronics, to dye sensitized solar cells, where molecular assemblies are integral components for modulating the optoelectronic properties of the devices.  Several key questions are addressed to foster the rational design of molecular based systems for these and other applications, and to guide their implementation.  These questions include how can directed molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals, hydrogen bonding and local cross-linking) influence electron transport behavior?  Researchers also want to know how molecular assemblies can be spatially confined and fabricated with precise architectures in nanoscopic junctions for potential device applications?  The team asks how the combined effects of spatial confinement and local intermolecular interactions within the assemblies and with surfaces afford control over their final resulting optical and electronic properties?  A series of self-assembled systems is explored, including porphryinoids, two-dimensional (2D) cross-linked diacetylenic thiols, and donor-acceptor dye molecules, such as perylene, dicyanonaphthalene and diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives.  These are selected because their tailorable optoelectronic properties make them reasonable targets as components for organic electronic devices.  Nanoscale assemblies of these materials are created on extended gold surfaces, and patterned gold nanostructures, to further explore the effects of exciton-plasmon coupling on the resulting optical and charge transport behavior of the assembled systems. The assembly processes and optoelectronic properties are measured in detail via a host of surface science approaches including, STM, AFM, XPS, IR and fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies.

Developing highly stretchable and resilient hydrogels could open up additional applications of these materials, for example in artificial muscles, in prosthetic devices towards assisting individuals with restricted mobility, energy harvesting, and enabling power amplification process in soft-robots. Biological elastomeric proteins such as resilin display high stretchability and resilience, but water-containing polymer networks prepared from synthetic monomers typically do not display such properties. High stretchability and resilience in biological elastomeric proteins have been attributed to the balanced combination of entropic and enthalpic elasticity originating from the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. In the proposed research, taking inspiration from these biopolymers, hydrogels with hydrophilic and hydrophobic contents will be synthesized using a facile chemical synthesis route. The synthesis strategy and characterization techniques that would be developed and implemented in this project will be applicable to other soft materials. Because of the cross-disciplinary nature of the project, the proposed research will impact many disciplines viz., polymer science, physics, robotics, and biology. In addition to the direct involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed research activities, the educational and outreach component will also include laboratory demonstrations and active involvement of K-12 students in research activities with the goal of introducing them to polymer science and engineering and encouraging interest in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\u2003&lt;br/&gt;PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the origin and nature of elasticity in hydrogels consisting of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components will be investigated. Particularly, the hydrogel considered for this project will be obtained by using free-radical polymerization of acrylic acid (AAc), methacrylamide (MAAm), and polypropylene glycol diacrylate (PPGDA). PPGDA is sparsely soluble in water at room temperature and will act as a hydrophobic block. Multiples of those blocks can associate to form hydrophobic domains in these gels. The resultant hydrogel is highly stretchable, resilient, and can achieve very high retraction velocity when released from a stretched state. It has been hypothesized that during stretching, the hydrophilic blocks display entropic elasticity, whereas dissociation of the hydrophobic domains, unwinding and stretching of the collapsed polypropylene glycol blocks in the aqueous media will have a significant enthalpic penalty. Similar to that observed in protein elastomers, a balance in enthalpic and entropic elasticity will render a hydrogel stiff, stretchable, and resilient. However, a fundamental understanding linking the structure and properties of these hydrogels is not clearly available. In the planned research, such will be addressed by systematically varying the monomer concentrations, hydrophobic content, hydrophobic block molecular weight, and solvent quality or temperature. Variation of these conditions will likely lead to the change in gel structure, which will then be linked to gel properties, particularly stretchability and resilience.  A systematic understanding will lead to establishing design principles for synthesizing stretchable and resilient hydrogels from synthetic polymers.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.8239827156066895, \"y\": 7.1595869064331055}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: Faithful Natural Language Generation\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Natural Language Generation is a fundamental component of many real-world applications, including generating captions for visually-impaired people.

Similarly, in the task of data-to-text generation (e.g., generating a Wikipedia biography from structured data) problem, deep learning models are prone to generate erroneous entities and attributes that do not belong to the input data. These behaviors significantly downgrade the performance of neural generative models, and the faithfulness of the output becomes a significant issue for building the next generation faithful natural language generation engines.

The chemistry and stoichiometry of titania particles are tuned through a novel flow-synthesis processing route and subsequent thermal annealing to make the material photoactive in the visible-light range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such light activation leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, which are believed to be central to the antiviral activity of such oxide materials. Being able to control and optimize the antiviral activity of materials such as titania, which can easily be coated onto surfaces or integrated into fibers, can have direct and immediate impact on the production of antimicrobial coatings and personal protective equipment (PPE). As such, the research results are proactively directed towards groups researching and developing PPE materials for the COVID-19 pandemic. The graduate students involved in the research are team-mentored in a highly interdisciplinary and societally relevant research activity that spans materials research, photochemistry, virology, and materials manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research program aims to develop the fundamental science linking the chemistry of titanium dioxide, or titania, to its antiviral properties. The research is motivated by the urgent need to develop coatings and personal protective equipment (PPE) that can inactivate the COVID-19 virus.  In this research, precise synthesis of titania nanoparticles is achieved via a micro-scale flow synthesis platform with in situ diagnostics. The high-throughput experimental platform enables the research team to study systematically the important variables of particle size, phase, and doping concentrations on the light absorption and photodynamic properties of titania. An important variable in the study is oxygen stoichiometry, which is systematically controlled through low-partial-pressure oxygen annealing. The reduction reaction induces oxygen vacancies into the titania lattice, which, in turn, lower the optical band gap of the material. The consequences for reactive oxygen species generation, which are critical for antiviral efficacy, have not, however, previously been established. Therefore, this research measures the effects of nanoparticle stoichiometry on the generation of individual reactive oxygen species: superoxide, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals under visible light illumination. Finally, the efficacy for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 surrogate coronaviruses is assessed, allowing for the development of full synthesis-structure-property-function relationships for this important antimicrobial photodynamic material. Moreover, the research translates the knowledge and processing conditions of the most efficacious materials to groups producing antiviral materials for the COVID-19 crisis.

In the context of the chemicals industry, a unique opportunity exists to utilize light alkane components of natural gas, such as ethane, as feedstocks for production of value-added chemicals.  Notably, ethane can be catalytically dehydrogenated to produce ethylene, which is a critically important building block feedstock for the manufacture of many types of polymers.  Current ethane dehydrogenation process economics are limited by low yields, which result from the prevalence of side reactions and catalyst deactivation.  The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a co-reactant enhances catalyst activity, facilitates high ethylene selectivity, and extends catalyst lifetimes.  Additionally, the CO2 (an industrial waste product and greenhouse gas) is converted to carbon monoxide (CO), which is itself a value-added product used in the chemicals industry.  Nevertheless, advances are needed in catalyst technology to assure commercial viability of carbon dioxide-assisted ethane dehydrogenation.

The particles floating on the interface can form stable particle rafts with unique properties that have inspired technological innovations such as liquid marbles and bicontinuous gels. In addition, aggregates of large granular particles on water surfaces are commonly seen in the open environment, ranging from the assembly of mosquito eggs, shade balls to prevent evaporation of reservoirs, to sand particles deployed to clean oil spills. Particle rafts of environmental importance are naturally subject to perturbations due to flow, which can affect the collective dynamics and stability of the raft. Yet, the connections between the dynamics of fluid-fluid interfaces and particle assembly remains unclear.  This project aims to address the issue by combing tabletop experiments with a theoretical investigation on the dynamics of granular rafts on moving interface. The results of the research will provide not only a fundamental understanding of the behavior of particle rafts in natural contexts, but also a new engineering tool to design and tailor macroscopic properties of particle assembly. The project will include an educational plan that emphasizes engagement of undergraduate students. The students and post-docs involved in the project will have outreach and networking opportunities with industrial partners though the industrial program at University of Minnesota. In addition, the visual nature of the research provides a good opportunity for integrating commonplace surface tension phenomena, such as \\u201cCheerio\\u2019s effects\\u201d, in undergraduate fluid mechanics courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this research is to gain fundamental understanding of particle rafts on a moving fluid-fluid interface, ranging from the assembly to macroscopic properties of the rafts. A particle raft is a monolayer of particles trapped at the interface between two fluids. As unique low-dimensional materials comprising discrete elements, particle rafts have a wide range of technical applications. However, the focus of the state of the art is on the particles themselves, while the fluid-fluid interface serves mostly as a passive site with a globally fixed geometry onto which particles can self-organize. Only limited studies have considered the dynamics of the rafts made of large granular particles, where gravity plays a dominant role. By combining experiments and theory, this project will directly address the role of the moving fluid-fluid interface in the assembly process and the mechanical properties of granular rafts. Experimentally, the PIs will investigate the influence of the moving interface on the structure of granular rafts and characterize the mechanical properties of resulting rafts via linear and nonlinear compression tests. In parallel to experiments, the PIs will develop a continuum model incorporating the intrinsic gravity-driven dynamics missing in the current theory of colloidal rafts. Together, the theoretical model and experimental measurements will provide a comprehensive physical understanding on the formation and the response of granular rafts under different interfacial perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.096105098724365, \"y\": 7.173136234283447}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"REU Site: Research Experience for Neurodiverse Students: Transforming the Nation's Aging Infrastructure by Advancing Radical Solutions\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Supported by the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers, this REU Site develops capacity in an area of national priority by increasing the number of individuals with expertise and creative problem-solving abilities in the field of aging civil infrastructure.

The proposed technology will enable efficient production of crops engineered with multiple trait genes, higher efficacy of the desired traits, and faster breeding and seed production to accelerate distribution. Unlike current solutions, the proposed technology ensures that traits will not be transferred to weeds or native plant species via pollen. The initial application is corn, the most valuable commercial crop in the US, with insights expected to enhance other crops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to create a chloroplast (plastid) transformation platform for engineering corn.

The available evidence indicates that the rate-limiting step is the need for a strong selection system to enable the identification and amplification of rare transformed plastids in the embryogenic tissue culture systems typical for monocots. This project will create a Master Transformation Recipient Line (MTRL) of corn for use in a chloroplast engineering platform. The MTRL will contain a targeted genome deletion in a chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic gene, allowing for development of a new selection system that can lead to successful chloroplast engineering of monocot crops.

For many of these activities, such robots must be able to grasp a wide variety of everyday objects or be capable of physical interactions with humans or other robots. While there are robotic grippers (\\\"end effectors\\\") well-suited for specific tasks, progress in cooperative robotics has been limited by a lack of \\\"universal\\\" gripping systems that can handle a diverse set of objects. Universal gripping systems have the potential to dramatically improve robot performance and reduce costs by decreasing the number of end effectors that a robot needs for general purpose functionality. This National Robotics Initiative (NRI) project will address this critical need by creating new material architectures that enable universal robotic grasping. This will be accomplished by using materials that are capable of changing their mechanical properties such as stiffness and adhesion, and incorporating these materials into contact pads that the robot will use for gripping. This work will promote domestic economic growth and well-being by impacting multiple sectors in which cooperative robots will have an important role, including manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, elderly care, and rehabilitation.

Von Neumann algebras were introduced by John von Neumann in his mathematical account of quantum mechanics and consist of infinite-sized matrices closed under various natural operations.  Quantum complexity theory considers the difficulty of solving or verifying solutions to decision problems using the quantum model of computation, that is to say, computers that run according to the laws of quantum physics as opposed to classical physics.  Recently, a landmark result in quantum complexity theory showed that classically unsolvable decision problems could be reliably verified by a quantum computer.  This quantum complexity result established a negative solution to a famous problem in operator algebras, the so-called Connes Embedding Problem, posed in 1976, which asks whether or not every von Neumann algebra can be approximated by a simple von Neumann algebra known as the hyperfinite II_1 factor.  Using techniques from model theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies classes of structures by examining what is expressible about them using first-order logic, the PI and a collaborator greatly simplified and elucidated the connection between the quantum complexity result and the solution to the Connes Embedding Problem.  This project plans to deepen the connection between these three areas by isolating the exact model-theoretic content behind the quantum complexity result and deducing further von Neumann algebraic consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the PI plans on extending the model-theoretic analysis of the quantum complexity result to understand the complexity of the full first-order theory of the hyperfinite II_1 factor; the PI's work with Hart established this connection for the one-quantifier theory.  In addition, the PI plans to pursue proofs of the failure of the Connes Embedding Problem which avoid the use of the quantum complexity result by using the model-theoretic notions of existentially closed models and Robinson forcing; due to the difficulty in proving the quantum complexity result, a new proof along these lines would serve as a great simplification of the resolution of the Connes Embedding Problem.  The project will also study other uses of model theory in von Neumann algebra theory, including furthering progress on Popa's embedding problem, which asks about the existence of certain kinds of ergodic embeddings of II_1 factors into ultrapowers.  The PI also plans on making progress on the C*-algebra version of the Connes Embedding Problem known as the Kirchberg Embedding Problem, which asks if every C*-algebra is approximated by the Cuntz algebra, an algebra of extreme importance in the classification program for nuclear C*-algebras.  Finally, while the majority of the model-theoretic study of von Neumann algebras has focused on so-called finite algebras, the PI plans on studying the model-theoretic properties of arbitrary von Neumann algebras through the lens of W*-probability spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.646030902862549, \"y\": 9.66609001159668}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"CAREER: Geospatial life cycle climate change impacts of solar and ocean renewable energy systems\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Life cycle assessment (LCA) practices are used to determine the climate change impacts of energy systems.

Decades of research has attempted to use this relationship to understand how habitat degradation might affect species abundance at different sites. For example, if the geographic range of a species is suddenly restricted due to land use change or other factors, how might local abundance in the other sites change? However, these so-called abundance-occupancy relationships are far from general. The proposed research aims to gauge the generality of abundance-occupancy relationships in a diverse set of species groups across both aquatic and terrestrial systems. In doing so, the research will estimate the dependency of these relationships on sampling procedures, geographic distribution, environmental conditions, and species groups. This collaborative research will involve the training of multiple graduate students, and the science will be incorporated into teaching and workshops aimed both at college undergraduates and high school students in underserved communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scaling of species abundance with occupancy is claimed to be a general law in population ecology and macroecology. However, the data to test these relationships often comes from non-standardized, opportunistic surveys of a small subset of species. Combined with the variety of statistical methods applied, there is mixed support for abundance-occupancy relationships for single species. Understanding the conditions which lead to this variability in evidence is an obtrusive knowledge gap challenging this fundamental macroecological hypothesis.

Further, the project will use theoretical models to determine the conditions under which abundance-occupancy relationships emerge.

Several challenges make the task of designing large-scale RNA structures hard. As an example, RNA compounds can be stable even when they are not minimum free-energy configurations. Also, experiments have shown how alternative configurations can exist for the same RNA sequence, with different associated levels of minimum free energy.

Communication between and within cells is critical in controlling all aspects of cellular activity, including cell growth, cell division, and cell death. One common way that cells communicate signals is by chemically changing proteins by adding or removing a phosphate group. The Barrios research group develops chemical tools that can be used to study the enzymes responsible for removing phosphate groups from proteins, providing insights into cellular mechanisms of communication. This project focuses on the newly discovered family of histidine phosphatase enzymes. The chemical tools being developed in this project have the potential to provide valuable insight into the roles played by these enzymes in cellular signaling and thus, provide fundamental insights into this poorly studied, but critically important, mode of cellular signaling. Key to the success of the project is the inclusion of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds with the goal of broadening participation in research. In addition, Dr. Barrios is committed to mentoring junior scientists and is working to create a university-wide framework to provide support and career development opportunities for postdoctoral researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reversible protein phosphorylation is widely used in biology to regulate protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways. While phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine in mammalian cells is widely recognized as critical, histidine phosphorylation is much less well understood. Recently, three mammalian histidine phosphatases have been discovered. These enzymes play critical roles in regulating ion channels, T-cell receptor signaling, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling, with additional, yet-undiscovered roles likely. Researchers in the Barrios lab are developing chemical probes that will facilitate monitoring the activity of individual histidine phosphatases both in vitro and in cells. Specifically, the Barrios lab is developing selective substrates and inhibitors of histidine phosphatase activity that can be used to address key questions about histidine phosphatase biology. This approach can readily be applied to almost any member of the histidine phosphatase family of enzymes. The research objectives are integrated with work aimed at broadening participation in science by engaging undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds and with efforts to enhance the framework for postdoctoral training through the development of programs that support early-career scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.567351818084717, \"y\": 6.106762409210205}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"RAPID: Collaborative Research: COVID-19 Preparedness in Remote Fishing Communities in Rural Alaska\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This time-sensitive RAPID project focuses on perception of COVID-19 risk in the Bristol Bay region of rural western Alaska.

Despite a decade of effort on the sustainability of digital infrastructure, the current design is still inadequate to achieve the 24/7 carbon-free goal. The current design focuses to minimize the energy cost and/or consumption or maximize renewable participation. The latter is the closest effort towards the decarbonization goal; however, when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, this design has no carbon intelligence, i.e., it obliviously draws energy from the grid without taking into account that the carbon intensity of grid changes over time due to existence of other carbon-free sources such as hydropower.

However, organisms have another option for generating movement:  they can use motor-like mechanisms to load energy into elastic structures, such that pre-loaded, rubber band-like elastic structures generate the movement, instead of motors. Latch-mediated spring actuation generates movement largely or exclusively using stored elastic energy and incorporates latches to mediate energy release, much like controlled release of a coiled spring.  This research examines how the size of an organism may determine whether movement is driven by stored elastic energy or direct motor action. Addressing this topic will improve understanding of fundamental physical limits on biological systems and how those limits influence development and evolution.  Biological latch-mediated spring actuation generates among the fastest movements ever recorded, which exceed the current capabilities of human engineering to produce extremely fast movements in small, reusable devices.

Therefore, it is critical to understand how the hydrological cycle responds to changes in climate as warming forces documented and projected changes in precipitation and extreme events. However, the effects of warming on evaporation are more challenging to anticipate, and without the evaporation term, the complete water budget cannot be constrained. By utilizing various existing proxies preserved in lake sediments, it is possible to track past precipitation and temperature, however there are few proxies that record evaporation. This project will help fill in this gap by developing the use of a group of biologically produced organic compounds called highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs). These HBIs are produced by diatoms and should contain a chemical signal of the lake water the diatoms live in. This project will focus on this connection between the HBIs and the signal of evaporation through a series of field-based modern calibrations and apply these calibrations to recent lake sediment archives to test their ability to reproduce evaporation.

Specifically, this work will consider diatom-derived highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) as a paleohydrology proxy. If the hydrogen isotopes of HBIs record lake water hydrogen isotopes, then, when combined with other proxies, past records of lake water evaporation can be generated to constrain the complete hydrologic cycle. To accomplish this, this project will first investigate how diatom growth habitat, water chemistry, and timing of HBI synthesis influences the hydrogen isotopic composition of HBIs. Diatom HBIs will be collected from pelagic and benthic habitats across a suite of lakes that vary in water chemistry (i.e., pH, salinity), as this influences diatom species composition. The timing of seasonality of HBI production will be determined by collection of bimonthly sediment trap samples from Brown\\u2019s Lake in northeastern Ohio over two years. Once these controls on HBI hydrogen isotopes are addressed, this project will then determine the sensitivity of HBI hydrogen isotopes in sediment archives to known changes in local hydroclimate. This will be completed by examining HBIs in lake sediments where established records of evaporation and precipitation already exist. The development of HBIs proposed here will provide site selection criteria and necessary calibration information to use hydrogen isotopes of HBIs as a proxy for lake water evaporation, ultimately improving paleohydrological reconstructions from lake sediments.

This project will build data management capacity at the community level, develop digital tools to store and share data and knowledge, and identify ways to better evaluate the use of data and knowledge to address management and decision-making needs, for example, related to climate adaptation and community planning, environmental and wildlife management, and cultural and place-based education. ELOKA\\u2019s collaborative project activities will contribute to improved Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) training, education, and leadership opportunities for Indigenous peoples, an underrepresented minority in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its fifth phase, ELOKA will collaborate with researchers and Arctic Indigenous communities to develop a community data management (CDM) system focused on enhancing the usefulness of community-based research and observing while supporting data sovereignty. As the first of four goals, ELOKA will co-develop a framework to assess the use and usefulness of CDM digital data infrastructures by convening two thematic working groups focused on place names and long-term observing. Working group members will co-develop use cases to document, examine and explore enhancements for how data management tools are used by communities and other end users. These will be synthesized to create a framework for developing useful and usable CDM applications. Second, this project will co-develop tools, including enhanced and new digital applications, to make community data more usable and useful for natural resource management, land use planning, teaching and curriculum development, language and cultural preservation, and long-term observing of Arctic change. Third, ELOKA will build capacity for data stewardship and Indigenous data sovereignty by providing trainings in partner communities, offering mini workshops at Arctic science meetings and conferences, and extending the use of ELOKA-developed atlases and databases in community institutions, including schools, wildlife management and hunter/harvester organizations, and community and regional planning offices. Fourth, this project will co-develop and implement a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) framework to guide project assessment and learning. ELOKA will contribute to understanding and advancing knowledge co-production through collaborative sharing of data and information that engages both Indigenous and scientific knowledge. An Indigenous co-production of knowledge leadership team will oversee the development of a research protocol, implementation of the project, and dissemination of results. ELOKA research will advance practices for community-driven and user-informed design of data management systems across the Arctic, with the potential to contribute to Arctic observing networks and to significantly improve prediction, planning and adaptation in the face of accelerating social and environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.592056751251221, \"y\": 5.284605979919434}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"NNA Track 1: Collaborative Research: Navigating Convergent Pressures on Arctic Development\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environment, and built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observation, Forecasting, Global Impact, and Resilient Infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few transformations are as dramatic or as complex as those occurring now in the Arctic. There are rapid changes in climate and the environment, in international treaties and regulations, in national security, and claims for territory. At the same time, Arctic communities and Indigenous Peoples are looking to find their place in a changing global economy. This convergence of changes and aspirations is leading to questions about what kinds of infrastructure are needed, where it should be located, and how this may impact Arctic people and environment. This project is using a combination of observations, satellites, maps, and models to identify where useful and viable locations for new development might be located. These kinds of data and analysis have not been combined before to make such an assessment. These locations are then explored with communities, emergency managers, environmental scientists, industry representatives, local governments, and members of Indigenous groups. Through this merging of environmental sciences, real-world engineering, financial analyses, and cultural concerns, the project is documenting likely future developments and understand their impacts on the Arctic environment and its people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alongside amplified Arctic environmental change, changes in global markets, regional geopolitics, and community aspirations are motivating visions of new opportunities to develop or enhance new industries in shipping, resource extraction, tourism, and fisheries. At the same time, Arctic communities and Indigenous peoples are making clear their aspirations for the future. This project asks how these converging pressures will shape Arctic development between now and 2050. The project is using an approach that is novel through its convergence of diverse disciplines, as follows. Plausible locations for development are being identified using natural resource distributions, national- and company-level ambitions, and community aspirations. High-resolution climate scenarios, observations, and satellite data are providing the environmental context for access and safety requirements. Financial and environmental assessments, regulations, and treaties provide a third layer of evaluation. The integrated product is then interrogated in an iterative manner with an independent International Reference Group of academic, Indigenous and practitioner experts. Through this process, the project is developing an assessment identifying convergent geophysical and socioeconomic pressures on Arctic development, and their potential cascading impacts on local communities, the environment, global commodity chains, and international relations.

Until recently, very little was known about the structural characteristics of wire silver and even less about how it forms. Surprisingly, this morphology can be created in the laboratory under simple conditions very different from those found in nature, yet their structural characteristics are very similar to natural samples. From the study of natural and synthetic specimens, it has been found that wire silver formation occurs by a solid-state process called \\u201cion conduction\\u201d, where metal ions can move directly through a crystal structure, and in this case, silver(I) ions move through the mineral argentite. Even more surprising, this ion transport during wire growth causes an enrichment of the heavy stable isotope 109Ag in the wire. This is opposite of that predicted by mechanisms of isotope enrichment known to occur in nature. Thus, further study of wire silver growth may elucidate a previously unrecognized mechanism for isotope separation in nature. Understanding this mechanism and the degree of possible isotope enrichment is significant for our basic understanding of physical and chemical phenomena. These in turn have direct application to the study of geochemical and geological processes such as metal transport and the isotopic signatures found in ore deposits. Broader impacts include possible technological applications where the isotope chemistry of materials can affect their physical properties. This study involves scientists from multiple academic departments and different disciplines, and will include student training and participation at multiple levels, from undergraduates through doctoral candidates. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This project integrates experimental mineralogy, analytical geochemistry and computational methods in the study of wire silver formation under highly controlled conditions as a means to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of the observed isotope effect. Isotope fractionation is hypothesized to result from the process of predissociation during superionic conduction, occurring preferentially for 109Ag+  ions as they move through the silver sulfide structure. The study will also test whether this isotope effect extends to other transition metals such as copper, zinc and nickel. Understanding the mechanisms, magnitude and direction of isotope fractionation is essential for the use and accurate interpretation of isotope data in geological studies, and allows for the engineered development of materials with \\u201ctuned\\u201d isotope chemistries. Finally, this unexploited physical phenomenon might be leveraged to improve the characteristics of technological devices that utilize fast ion conduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.343670845031738, \"y\": 8.045433044433594}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"MRI: Acquisition of a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer and Equipped with Solid-State Probes\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs.

Computational methods trained to emulate this capability rely on observing millions of examples of visual input paired with human annotations. These computational methods have made great progress and are being increasingly adopted in many user-facing applications such as image search, automated image tagging, semi-autonomous navigation systems, smart virtual assistants, etc. However, the underlying visual recognition models in these systems often produce errors by associating sensitive variables of societal significance with their predictions. The goal of this project is to measure and mitigate such errors in a systematic fashion. For example, if a method is able to recognize images of scenes such as 'classroom', the goal of this project is to ensure that such predictions are obtained based on cues such as the presence of a whiteboard, chairs, desks, and other elements typically needed for a space to function as a classroom and not based on incidental elements such as the characteristics or attributes of people present in the classroom.

The developed methods will be based on solid foundations drawn from both the machine learning, computer vision, and software testing communities. The project introduces association tests to probe models trained under a variety of conditions to systematically disentangle the biases introduced during generic visual representation learning. The project will be 1) developing a general assessment methodology to measure various types of biases in generic visual representation learning, 2) proposing methods to diminish the impact of these biases in existing generic visual representation extraction models, and 3) measuring the impact of these biases on some key downstream tasks.

The proposed research will establish the foundations of future smart, adaptive, and resource-efficient sensing systems for a variety of applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, radar, and wireless communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three interconnected objectives (i) Developing learning-based physics-aware multi-dimensional signal reconstruction techniques through foundational relations to regularized inverse problems and explainable architectures inspired from existing signal processing models, (ii) Developing mathematical and learning-based adaptive and task-oriented measurement design approaches with jointly optimized sensing, reconstruction and processing blocks, and demonstrate its impacts on real-world problems, (iii) Developing a learning-based data-to-decision framework, which infers actionable information (classification, parameter estimation) directly from low number of learned measurements. The central theme of planned synergistic educational and outreach activities is to increase the scientific literacy of both the K-12 and university students and the public regarding sensing systems, signal processing, and machine learning. Because sensing technologies are on the frontier of how information is perceived and extracted, and are essential to a wide range of applications, this project will have a high impact on sensing technologies being developed to improve the quality of our daily lives, ranging from applications of cameras to biomedical imaging, or from smart home technologies to autonomous vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.656478404998779, \"y\": 8.686615943908691}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"RAPID: Analysis of Multiscale Network Models for the Spread of COVID-19\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has upended the daily lives of more than a billion people worldwide, and governments are struggling with the task of responding to the spread of the disease. Uncertainty in transmission rates and the outcomes of social distancing, \\\"shelter-at-home\\\" executive orders, and other interventions have created unprecedented challenges to the United States health care system. This project will address these issues directly using advanced mathematical modeling from dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and networks. The mathematical models, which are formulated with the specific features of COVID-19 in mind, will provide insights that are critical to people on the front lines who need to make recommendations for intervention strategies and human-behavior patterns to best mitigate the spread of this disease in a timely manner. The project will train a postdoctoral scholar, a PhD student, and two undergraduate students in the research needed to solve these complex problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard approach for epidemic modeling, at the community scale and larger, is compartmental models in which individuals are in one of a small number of states (for example, susceptible, infected, recovered, exposed, latent), with individuals moving between states. The COVID-19 epidemic can be modeled in this way, with resistance as part of the dynamics. The simplest examples of such models for large populations are coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the fraction of a population in each of the states. To model the stochasticity of infection and latency, models with self-exciting point processes can be fit to real-world data. This project compares the dynamical systems and stochastic models of relevance to COVID-19 transmission. The models also incorporate network structure for the transmission pathways. The project extends prior research on contagions on multilayer networks by incorporating multiple transmission methods and coupling between the spread of the contagion itself and human behavior patterns.

An example is how an airfoil behaves when the air ahead is turbulent. In these cases, one needs to simulate many scenarios, an exceedingly expensive proposition. This project aims to develop mathematical tools to make this process more feasible and computationally affordable by taking advantage of multilevel hierarchies in the sampling and solution approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many processes in the sciences and engineering are described by parameter-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) whose numerical solution is expensive. While their forward solution may be feasible, the computational cost makes it difficult or impossible to statistically evaluate questions such as (i) to quantify the uncertainty in output variables given a known or assumed distribution of parameter values, or (ii) to solve the statistical inverse problem of inferring a probability distribution among parameters from noisy measurements. Both of these questions are typically answered through high-dimensional and consequently very expensive sampling methods. This project will use hierarchical and multilevel decompositions of PDE solvers, coupled with error estimates, to derive vastly faster methods to obtain a sufficient number of samples to achieve statistical sampling with prescribed accuracy. The approach implies that whenever possible, samples and PDE solutions can happen on coarse, cheap levels of their respective hierarchies, and expensive solves are performed only when necessary.

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world\\u2019s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease.

Individuals with neuromuscular impairment -- perhaps due to stroke or spinal cord injury -- may have difficulty carrying out the activities of everyday life. This project explores novel interfaces through which an individual can use their body's residual mobility to issue commands to assistive devices such as computer cursors, wheelchairs, or robotic arms. The project has three main research goals. The first is to improve existing methods for translating small body movements into controller commands for assistive devices. The second is to model the process by which the human user learns over time to use the body-machine interface. The third is to apply the obtained model of the learning process to enable the body-machine interface to adjust to the evolving characteristics of the human user. An interface that does not adapt to changes in its user may significantly degrade in performance over time. On the other hand, an interface whose properties instantly change with every small shift in user behavior will be difficult to control. The ultimate outcome of this project will be human-machine interfaces based on body movement that consider the user and the interface as two components of an integrated system in which each component continually learns from and adapts to the other. The results of the project will lead to assistive devices that more affordable, and provide more versatile control and ease of use. The underlying principles of co-adaptation to be identified through this work are also relevant to rehabilitation from disease or injury, as well as to increasing the capabilities of human-operated robotic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work has shown that linear methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) may be effectively used in a body-machine interface (BoMI) to map elements from a higher dimensional feature space of body movements onto a lower dimensional space of device commands. In this project, the features that provide input to the BoMI are generated by multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn by the user; the IMUs report their current orientation in an inertial reference space. The output from the BoMI are commands used to control a sequence of representative devices, specifically a computer cursor, a simulated wheelchair, an actual wheelchair, and a simulated manipulator arm. The three technical goals of the project are as follows: 1) Compare the performance of a linear map based on PCA to a nonlinear map based on an autoencoder network (AEN) for providing input features to the BoMI that translates residual mobility space features into device commands. The AEN is capable of representing a richer variety of features than PCA, but it remains to be shown, for example, whether human users can make effective use of that variety. 2) Obtain a computable representation of the process by which humans learn neuromotor skills. This representation will be based on the premise that humans simultaneously learn both a forward and inverse map of the relationship between neuromotor signals and the resulting physical outcomes. Once learned, the forward map predicts the outcomes that will result from a certain set of signals, while the inverse map is used to generate the signals that correspond to a given desired physical outcome. As a person learns mastery of a neuromotor skill, the forward and inverse maps become more accurate predictors of actual behavior, and the degree of learning can be monitored through estimates of these maps. 3) Incorporate a co-adaptation algorithm into the BoMI for maintaining performance as the user's mastery of the BoMI changes. In most current approaches to human-machine interfaces, the interface is fixed following an initial calibration stage, and the user must learn to control that interface configuration. In this project, the learning representation of objective (2) will be used to monitor and periodically update the BoMI map parameters. The implementation of this objective is aided by parallels between the human learning model and the AEN training method, which automatically generates a decoder network that captures the inverse map between desired device commands and the corresponding residual mobility features needed to produce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.20949649810791, \"y\": 7.9086079597473145}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Entangled Photon Pairs on Demand\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The concept of quantum entanglement has been a key driving force of the Quantum Information Science (QIS) revolution.

Using cameras mounted on the robot and a virtual reality headset, a person can see the environment around the robot. However, controlling the robot using existing technologies is hard: there is a time delay because it\\u2019s slow to send high quality video over the Internet. In addition, the fidelity of the image is worse than looking through human eyes, with a fixed and narrow view. This proposal will address these limitations by creating a new system which understands the geometry and appearance of the robot\\u2019s environment. Instead of sending high-quality video over the Internet, this new system will only send a smaller amount of information about how the environment\\u2019s geometry and appearance has changed over time. Further, understanding the geometry and appearance will let us expand the view visible to the person.

This system will result in dexterous teleoperation that enables remote human operators to perform complex tasks with remote robot manipulators, such as cleaning a room or repairing a machine. Such tasks have not previously been demonstrated to be teleoperated for two reasons: 1) lack of an intuitive awareness and understanding of the scene around the remote robot, and 2) lack of an effective low-latency interface to control the robot. We will address these problems by creating new scene- and network-aware algorithms which tightly couple sensing, display, interaction and transmission, enabling the operator to quickly and intuitively understand the environment around the robot. This project will research new interfaces which allow the operator to use their hand to directly specify the robot\\u2019s end effector pose in six degrees of freedom, combined with spatial- and semantic-object-based models that allow safe high-level commands.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in disruptions in the usual operations of healthcare services. However, such services are more essential now than ever; consequently, many organizations have rapidly transitioned to providing them digitally. Yet, these efforts are impeded by the lack of preexisting socio-technical infrastructures. It is also unclear what role the complexity of tasks, systems, resource requirements, and overall processes plays in the ability of low-income users to use such services, and whether they may benefit from service digitization. This is critical to understand in low income communities where many residents have limited access to broadband Internet and newer devices, and have fewer digital literacy skills. Consequently, they are more likely to experience barriers to digital service use. This is cause for concern since health informatics research has shown that technologies that increase effort for health-related activities can widen socioeconomic inequalities in health. However, past human-computer interaction research suggests that intermediaries such as non-profit organizations and family members can mitigate such barriers in low-income contexts.  In line with NSF RAPID goals, the study will gather ephemeral data concerning the challenges faced by a cadre of first-time, low-income telehealth users. It will also gather information concerning technology intermediation during this crisis, including ad-hoc and temporary solutions that may soon disappear or fade from memory, and will disseminate results quickly in order to reduce harm to low-income Americans during this health crisis.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to address these difficulties and prevent unequal benefit through sociotechnical design for complexity reduction, including use of technology intermediaries.

Once the dashboard and web browser extension are developed in this exploratory project, the machine learning tools can be improved and deployed nationally for use by undergraduate students and instructors.  These tools have the potential for significant impact on undergraduate education, since they can assist instructors with assessing and providing feedback on writing, even in large classes.  Tools that can automate the process, even partially, could enhance the use of written assignments and assessments in STEM classes, thus helping students increase their reasoning and written communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement and study the efficacy of a writing dashboard and browser extension in three large introductory science courses. The dashboard will identify pairs of phrases that represent claims and evidence to support those claims. It will also score writing based on its use of jargon and its readability. The dashboard will be designed for instructors to use as a formative assessment tool that can provide constructive feedback on student writing. It will complement the instructor\\u2019s grading process, providing a vehicle for discussing attributes associated with good scientific writing. The web browser extension will help students identify evidence-based scientific claims on the internet. Using the same machine learning technology as the writing dashboard, the browser extension will identify and highlight claims and evidence in articles available online and give an overall rating for the article\\u2019s likely scientific quality, along with a rationale for the rating. The tools will be studied in three introductory science courses taken by non-science majors: astronomy, geosciences, and evolutionary biology. Students will be required to use the dashboard for three writing assignments, and they will use the browser extension for activities that require them to review and rate online scientific articles. To study potential improvements in students\\u2019 scientific reasoning capacity, the project will adapt existing survey instruments and administer the revised surveys to students before and after the intervention.

Crustal formation within volcanic arcs is a profoundly important process that continually replenishes the mass of the continents, whose constant weathering and erosion provide the source of elemental nutrients that drive Earth's biogeochemical cycles.  Remarkably, the creation of new continental material and the recycling of material back into the mantle have remained balanced on Earth over hundreds of millions of years. Understanding this balance is key to understanding the habitability of the planet. All of Earth's crust is created from partial melts of the deeper mantle that rise upward and then freeze to form the crust.  The building blocks of continental crust form when water released from a subducting tectonic plate lowers the melting temperature of the mantle, creating magma that rises and accumulates in volcanic arcs.  The process of arc-crust formation has been the focus of many studies, but our understanding of these process is far from a complete.  Questions persist because arc processes are complex and episodic, they occur over a range of spatial scales and depend on variables such as the age of the subducting plate and the evolutionary stage of a given arc, which may never reach a steady state.  The study location of this project is the Andreanof segment of the Aleutian arc.  Coincidentally, this location coincides with the epicenter of the 1957 Great Aleutian earthquake, the third largest earthquake of the last century and with the largest aftershock zone of any earthquake ever recorded.  Active-source seismic techniques will be used to image the seismic velocity structure of the entire crust along and across this arc segment to address many of the unanswered questions of arc-crust formation.  These same methodologies can be used to address questions related to earthquake and volcanic hazards common to volcanic arcs.  The education component of this project will train a cohort of the next generation of scientists in the acquisition and advance analyses of these types of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this grant an active-source seismic experiment will be conducted in the Andreanof segment of the Aleutian arc in order to study arc-crust formation processes.  Many basic questions about arc-crust formation processes remain, including the source and variability of primary arc magmas, where and how these magmas fractionate to produce the characteristic arc geochemical signatures of crustal rocks, the role of water in all of these processes, the bulk composition of arc crust and its basic architecture and similarity to continental crust, the forcing functions for all of these processes and the temporal and spatial variability of those forcings, and the mass balance of the entire system.  Substantial advance can be made by focused, multi-disciplinary study of an arc segment that has simple, well known magmatic and tectonic histories, well studied geochemistry, and sufficient along-strike variability to capture many of the processes that are believed to control arc-crust geochemical and structural evolution.  The Andreanof segment is one of very few locations that satisfy these criteria. It consists of an intact, arc massif formed during three identifiable and dated magmatic episodes; it is only modestly deformed and exhibits along-strike variability in active volcanism from primarily basaltic in the east to andesitic/dacitic in the west.  The seismic experiment supported by this grant will consist of one transect along the entire length of the segment and two arc-crossing transects.  Multi-channel seismic (MCS) data, recorded on an 8-km-long streamer, and ocean-bottom seismic data, with instrument spacings of 10 to 15 km, will be acquired along each transect, and these data will be analyzed with advanced tomographic and MCS imaging methodologies to produce seismic velocity and reflectivity images that will reveal, for the first time, the full crustal architecture of an intact arc massif at a segment scale.  These images will provide estimates of composition that will inform models of melt emplacement and fractionation, and enable a number of specific questions to be addressed, including: What is the bulk composition, thickness and basic architecture of oceanic-arc crust, How are variations in factors such as primary magma composition and crustal processing of magmas expressed in bulk arc crustal composition and structure, and What is the fate of mafic/ultra-mafic cumulates?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 8.156594276428223, \"y\": 6.348100185394287}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: SaTC: CORE: Small: Privately Collecting and Analyzing V2X Data for Urban Traffic Modeling\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"When widely deployed, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications in connected vehicles can result in very large-scale and valuable datasets that can be useful for a wide range of transportation safety, mobility, and other related applications.

This work promises to advance scientific knowledge by enabling researchers to fit more flexible and realistic models accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty in data, and to advance societal goals by facilitating more accurate and granular estimates of exposure, reproduction rate, and other aspects of epidemic spread that inform public and private decision making. This project also provides professional development opportunities for a post-doctoral researcher, as well as student training.<br/><br/>The research will be done in the open-source programming language Stan, which has already been used in several influential COVID-19 models as well as in economics, political science, biology, political science, and many other application areas.  Specifically, the project includes:  documentation and language features to make Stan programs easier to write and evaluate; continuation and extensions of existing collaborations on mathematical models for epidemic spread, causal models for estimating policy effects, and survey adjustment; and improved implementations for differential-equation models, which serve as the core of models for disease transmission and other diffusive social and biological processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.538231611251831, \"y\": 6.562504291534424}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"I-Corps: Biodegradable plastics that incorporate plastic degrading enzymes\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to make environmentally friendly plastics. Compostable plastics, one of the fastest growing innovations in the space, promises to enable a circular materials economy. Unfortunately, there is currently poor access to industrial compost nationally, and building infrastructure is costly. Our technology streamlines this degradation process, requiring only water and heat, to produce small molecules than can be readily composted, or turned back into high quality plastics. The global plastic market is $234 B, and successful commercialization could positively impact environmental sustainability while meeting the needs of industry to maintain modern quality of life. The technology can potentially be used for solutions across a breadth of applications, ranging from industrial chemistry to energy generation to biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project supports efforts toward translation of a class of materials called random heteropolymers (RHPs). RHPs effectively stabilize enzymes in foreign environments, such as organic solvents or within plastics. Enzymes are nature\\u2019s chemists, performing chemical transformations with unparalleled efficiency and specificity within cells. However, enzymes are typically fragile and perform poorly, if at all, once removed from the cell. The proposed RHP technology enables enzymes to be covered in a nano-scale shell that shields them from the environment without harming their function. RHPs can be used to embed the enzymes that degrade plastic materials inside of the plastics. Upon triggering, the plastics biodegrade rapidly and completely, leaving behind no microplastics. The monomers can be recaptured and reused to make new plastics or disposed of as compost. The materials can also be processed using current manufacturing techniques. Altogether, this provides an opportunity to produce materials that meet the needs of industry while providing a better end of life with minimal investment in infrastructure. More broadly, RHPs offer the functionality of natural or engineered enzymes with the utility of plastics as a novel approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 5.393976211547852, \"y\": 6.525413990020752}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Plasmon-induced Triplet Energy Transfer (PITET) for Photon Upconversion\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is supporting Dr. Ming Lee Tang at the University of California Riverside (UCR) to study the energy transfer process of plasmonic systems.  Plasmonics refers to light-induced oscillation of loosely bound electrons in metals.  This research is important for catalysis, imaging, and energy conversion applications. Minuscule metal particles with dimensions on the order of nanometers have been treasured historically for their beauty in stained glass windows. The vivid colors in stained glass arise from the strong absorption and scattering of light due to plasmons supported by the metal nanoparticles. Dr. Tang\\u2019s team is conducting fundamental research that addresses that seeks to efficiently transfer the energy stored as plasmons in metal nanoparticles to neighboring chemical molecules.  The research aims to provide mechanisms to prevent the system from unwanted energy loss through rapid scattering of light or dissipation of energy as heat.  Such advances are essential for the development of metal nanoparticles for intended applications in photocatalysis and in solar cells. The team designs and synthesizes various nanomaterial architectures.  Plasmons tightly confined within the nanoscale metal architectures are then characterized to tune the system to perform useful work upon light activation.  This research also has broader impacts of engaging the general public in the Inland Empire program in Southern California.

The goal is to use light captured by metal nano-antennas for photon upconversion, a process of converting low energy photons from incoherent sources such as the sun to useful high energy photons. Novel light-absorbing nanostructures based on noble metals in this research can absorb near-infrared photons to produce violet photon emissions from neighboring anthracene- and perylene-based chromophores. Specifically, silver nanoprisms and gold nanorods with their localized surface plasmon resonance tuned between 1.5 and 1.8 eV are expected to be resonant with the lowest excited triplet states of the chromophores, so as to photosensitize the molecular triplet states across an oxide barrier. Steady-state photon upconversion measurements will be used to quantify the efficiency of plasmon-induced triplet energy transfer. Time resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements provide independent measurements of the yield and rate of the triplet energy transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.312985420227051, \"y\": 8.317519187927246}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Building Capacity, Generating Knowledge, and Fostering Community to Define and Disseminate What Works in STEM Teacher Preparation for High-Need School Districts\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"The project aims to serve the national need of advancing research about and use of evidence-based practices in STEM teacher preparation programs, particularly to prepare teachers who can support student success in high-need school districts.

Equity has become a niche focus for many science education scholars, but the idea that science education should reach all students should be fundamental to all high quality teaching and learning. Scholars have documented policies and strategies that expand the diversity of individuals engaging in science. In turn, practitioners have incorporated these advances into science classroom practice. Better science learning opportunities can occur without diminishing expectations. However, many important projects are only known to local participants and a few outsiders. The conference will gather these scattered materials into a centralized collection. Producing consensus documents about equity-centered science education will provide a common body of knowledge. Having these shared referents will help to consolidate and coordinate research activity. Such documents will also have value for science education stakeholders engaged in professional development, policy enactments, and instructional reforms. The second purpose of this project is to plan for sustaining these efforts beyond the time of the conference. Because of current societal and educational dynamics, it is important to be strategic and planful about subsequent and synchronized ventures within an ongoing campaign for equity centered science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demographical and institutional shifts make it necessary to attend to inequities within science education. Disparities by race and ethnicity are troublingly persistent in terms of representation in science careers, of college students majoring in science and engineering, by secondary school enrollments in advanced science courses, and in K-12 student outcomes on measures of science achievement. Such patterns are often reduced to deficit thinking about human potential. Deficit explanations are related to biased expectations by classroom teachers, inappropriate course tracking practices within secondary schools, uneven attention and support by college advisors and university faculty, and hostile work environments throughout academic and corporate STEM settings. In contrast, introducing asset mindsets about marginalized populations has the potential to contradict biased views about who can and cannot be successful in science. This project is creating a multifaceted mentoring initiative to assist scholars with maximizing impacts and sustaining themselves within their chosen professions. Among participants, there is considerable variety of career trajectories and depth of experiences.

A possible solution to such a risk is to implement privacy-preserving protocols between users and third parties that prevent any private information disclosure in the first place. For instance, a user could prove to a third party that she holds a valid password without revealing the password. While solutions for such privacy-preserving problems exist, such solutions are poorly adapted to the open-access, noisy, bandwidth-limited, and distributed nature of wireless networks. Resorting to privacy-preserving protocols unadapted to wireless communication networks may result in suboptimal/inefficient solutions or, even worse, compromise privacy. This project addresses this challenge with a novel framework for privacy-preserving communication specifically adapted to wireless networks. The anticipated benefits are stronger privacy guarantees, improved data rates, and improved scalability, compared to traditional approaches. The project integrates an educational component in the broad field of cybersecurity under the form of i) graduate student training, ii) project- and research-oriented undergraduate student education, and iii) outreach to K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to build a comprehensive framework that will enable the fundamental understanding and design of privacy-preserving wireless communication protocols.

Effective production/inventory management to match the supply with the demand is a key element to the success of remanufacturing industry. However, the complexity of such problems and the uncertainties involved in the remanufacturing process make the conventional production planning methods difficult to apply.

The primary aim of this project is to provide a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics of these novel surface microstructures and show that they can provide systematic control of wall turbulence to minimize skin-friction drag.

In practice, however, the cumbersome and invasive nature of blood draws, and the labor-intensive nature of their subsequent laboratory analysis has precluded the personalization of dosing. In the face of this, clinicians base dosing decisions on indirect, and thus often highly inaccurate estimators of drug concentrations in the body, leading to undesired side effects and &gt;$500 billion in additional annual cost to the health-care system. Given this, there exists a major need for technologies supporting convenient and accurate measurement of drug concentrations at the point of care, with even greater value if such technology could be used by patients at home or work.  Performing rapid measurement of drug concentrations can be complex, however, because a significant fraction of most drugs is bound to blood proteins.  The project proposes an aptamer based biochemical sensor capable of performing rapid, point-of-care measurements of both protein-bound and unbound drug concentrations for personalized medicine. The work includes an integrated education plan that involves the participation of undergraduate research co-ops with a focus on underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this proposal is design and fabrication of biochemical sensor device that can rapidly measure both the active (unbound) and the total (unbound+protein bound) concentrations of drugs in blood circulation. The proposed research is based on the hypothesis that microfluidic devices can quickly sample biofluids such as blood and interstitial fluid, and efficiently denature the binding-protein for the drug such that both the unbound and total (unbound+protein-bound) drug concentrations can be measured by quantitative electrochemical aptamer sensors.  This will be accomplished by implementing a novel membrane that protects the drug-detecting sensor from the harsh conditions necessary to liberate protein-bound drugs.  Specifically, the membrane will be permeable to drugs but will be impermeable to acids and bases needed to release drug from proteins and which would otherwise harm the sensor.  The proposal aims to advance knowledge spanning the physics of membranes, the influence of acid, base, and salt conditions on sensors, and shed new light on the percentage of drugs that are bound to proteins in the body.  The understanding of how much drug is bound to proteins will lead to fundamental knowledge of the unbound portion of drug in blood that provides a therapeutic effect, as well as causes toxicity or unwanted side-effects. The technique will provide information on drug bioavailability, toxicity, interference, metabolism, clearance, and absorption rates.

The proposed system is anticipated to have applications in both agriculture and healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will leverage a technology recently invented at the NSF IUCRC Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics (CADMIM, NSF Award IIP-1841509) that enables the formulation of large arrays of genetic measurements through the use of detailed networks of miniaturized plumbing. This PFI team has previously demonstrated that the proposed system is capable of performing the distribution and mixing operations required to prepare the targeted genetic measurement reactions. However, the reactions themselves have yet to be demonstrated. This PFI project will transition the technology to a new material platform that will be faster to manufacture and more conducive to performing the required biochemical reactions. The error rate of the genetic measurements will also be characterized, and the manufacturing processes will be tuned to improve accuracy. Finally, the number of genetic measurements per device will be scaled up, with a target of performing about 6000 measurements simultaneously on each device. The expected technical endpoint of this project will be a fully functional prototype ready for testing by different companies in the plant agriculture industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 4.821756839752197, \"y\": 6.895015716552734}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Nanoscale Charge Transfer in Quantum Dots Connected with Molecular Switches\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project aims to discover new ways of controlling how electrons move across arrays of quantum dots by using light as a switch.

Such phenomena can be exploited to make materials for optically switchable components for optical computing and memory devices that are faster and more efficient compared to traditional electronics. Broadly, this research has a potential to advance the fundamental understanding of nanoscale charge transfer which is crucial for understanding optical and electrical processes in macromolecular, nanoscale, and biological systems. The research activities are integrated with educational efforts aimed at enhancing the recruitment, training, and retention of students in the science and engineering fields, especially among underrepresented groups at the University of Virginia and Old Dominion University. With an emphasis on middle and high school students, hands-on activities on 'Switching Molecules with Light' are provided. Undergraduate researchers are recruited through the Virginia-North Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation and other programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to test a hypothesis that the rates of charge transfer and exciton dissociation in colloidal quantum dot assemblies can be modulated by changing conformation of the 'bridge' photochromic molecules that inter-connect the quantum dots. To this end, a combination of nanoparticle synthesis, organic synthesis, surface chemistry characterization, optical spectroscopy, electrical measurements and X-ray scattering is employed. In the context of Marcus theory, the impact of potential barrier height on nanoscale charge transfer is systematically studied while keeping exactly the same charge donor-acceptor pair and the surface chemistry at contacts. This research has a potential to result in the discovery of a novel class of quantum dot assemblies with optically switchable light emission and non-volatile \\u2018read\\u2019 and \\u2018write\\u2019 operations. The dense, fast and reliable on-chip compatible non-volatile optical memory materials potentially obtained through this research can lead to new research directions and capabilities for optical computing, data storage, processing and transmission. The research team from the two universities will (1) determine the relationship between the potential barrier height and the rates of charge transfer and exciton dissociation in quantum dot assemblies in the context of Marcus theory, (2) investigate the relationship between bridge molecule structure and functional groups on charge transfer and exciton dissociation in quantum dot assemblies, and (3) demonstrate quantum dot assemblies with optically switchable photoluminescence intensity.

Consequently, biomaterials with structure and function tunable by shear represent powerful tools to detect and rectify pathological processes induced by abnormal flows in the body. For the past few decades, shear-responsive hydrogels and molecular assemblies have been widely explored. However, single-biomolecule based shear responders remains a poorly-tapped subject, despite such materials could better mimic natural functions in circulation, delivering more accurate spatial and temporal responses with function reversibility. This project will design and characterize novel Single-MOlecule based materials with switchable structures and functions REsponsive to Shear flows (SMORES). Owing to the modular design, the material concept can be generalized to other constructs capable of responding to abnormal flows in the circulatory system towards novel diagnostics and therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases in the long term. This project will provide fundamental insights into biomechanics of polymer devices under the influence of ligands and the flow environment, perspectives that have not been studied in depth before. Rational design of biomaterials containing both bio- and nonbio- functionalities to achieve predictable flow responses will advance the fields of materials science, biomechanics, bio-conjugation, molecular engineering and bio-transport.

The function is switched on by conformational changes under high shear and is enabled by an extremely complicated molecular structure: vWF is comprised of tens to hundreds of monomer units, each of which contains more than ten domains. To demonstrate that an artificial material of modular design could achieve a similar function to vWF, i.e. binding cells at high shear, we propose the construction SMORES to inhibit or promote the cell binding activity of the vWF\\u2019s platelet binding domain under shear control. Shear dependent cell binding to the proposed material will be characterized and correlated with molecular conformations studied by single-molecular force spectroscopy, microfluidic imaging experiments and computer modeling.

The OSNAP observing system consists of two legs: one extending from southern Labrador to the southwestern tip of Greenland across the mouth of the Labrador Sea (OSNAP West), and the second from the southeastern tip of Greenland to Scotland (OSNAP East). The observing system also includes subsurface floats (OSNAP Floats) in order to trace the pathways of overflow waters in the basin and to assess the connectivity of currents crossing the OSNAP line. The location of the OSNAP East and West legs purposefully melds with a number of long-term observational efforts in the North Atlantic: the Canadian repeat hydrography program in the Labrador Sea; the German Labrador Sea western boundary array at 53\\u00b0N; the global Ocean Observatories Initiative node to be placed in the southwestern Irminger Sea; the repeat hydrographic sections across the Irminger and Iceland basins; and the Ellett line in the Rockall region. Substantial international collaboration has been garnered for OSNAP, including measurement contributions from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada. Importantly, this proposed observing system, in conjunction with the RAPID/MOCHA array at 26\\u00b0N and the European Union NACLIM program at Nordic Seas overflows, will provide the first comprehensive three-dimensional measure of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and provide a means to evaluate inter-gyre connectivity in the North Atlantic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will implement the OSNAP West  section and the OSNAP Float program. The primary observational components are: (i) a mooring array across the eastern margin of the Labrador Sea, where the subpolar boundary current enters the basin. This array will complement an analogous array across the western margin at the exit point of the Labrador Sea, maintained by institutions in Germany and Canada; (ii) a sequential release of acoustically tracked floats in the lower limb of the AMOC at the OSNAP East and OSNAP West boundary arrays. These floats will be seeded in the two densest components of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) over the four-year period of the measurement program (2014-2018).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: For decades oceanographers have understood the AMOC to be highly susceptible to changes in the production of NADW. However, a number of recent observational and modeling studies have called into question this supposition, as more has been learned about the role of wind forcing in AMOC variability. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to establish an observing system that will determine the role that intermediate and deep water mass formation and basin-scale wind forcing play in the overturning and associated poleward heat transport, assessments that currently have only been theorized and modeled, but not observed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In January of 2007, the US Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology identified the study of the AMOC as one of four near-term priorities in the US Ocean Research Priorities Plan. This proposed work directly addresses that priority via a design of an AMOC observing system in the sub-polar North Atlantic. While a primary motivation for studying AMOC variability comes from its potential impact on the climate system, additional motivation for the measure of the heat, mass and freshwater fluxes in the sub-polar North Atlantic arises from their potential impact on marine biogeochemistry and the cryosphere. There is growing evidence that the ocean has played (and is playing) a role in the reduction of Arctic sea ice and in mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet - both of which have been attributed to changes in the poleward heat transport by the ocean. Also, the ocean plays an essential role in the carbon cycle by moderating increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 through the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean. Variability in the AMOC is expected to impact this sequestration.

Better tools for fingerprinting how different species access rock moisture are needed to understand how shifts in precipitation could impact local water resources. This experiment tracks water flow through soil, bedrock, and trees via isotopic tracers to document how forest water use influences of groundwater recharge and stream flow, especially during drought.

The research will be conducted by a team of researchers located at the University of Kansas, the University of Notre Dame, Texas A&amp;M University, and Rutgers University in collaboration Brookhaven National Lab, Oak Ridge National Lab and the National Institute of Standards and Technology and two industry partners (Chemours and Iolitec). The technical, economic, and environmental impacts of the project are considerable, given the large inventory of high GWP refrigerants that must be removed from the market. The market for recycling refrigerants is valued at more than a billion dollars and preventing the release of high-GWP refrigerants into the Earth\\u2019s atmosphere is equivalent to eliminating 175 million metric tons of CO2 (or annual emissions from 50 million cars). The project has the potential to economically benefit the refrigerants business and provide a distributed chemical manufacturing process for over 100 EPA certified recyclers in the U.S. A multi-faceted strategy will be employed to maximize dissemination and knowledge sharing with the broader scientific community. The four lead institutions are committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment and will recruit five PhD students, one post-doctoral researcher, and eight undergraduates. These researchers will be provided with cross-disciplinary training in science and engineering, attend STEM workshops and safety meetings, and intern in partnering universities, companies, and national labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide the fundamental knowledge and innovation required to recycle and repurpose high-GWP refrigerants. The project is built upon the tunable solvation properties of ionic liquids (ILs) to realize the separation of azeotropic HFC mixtures that are not possible with other materials. The two primary goals are (1) designing chemical separations with high selectivity and capacity for complex systems and (2) understanding temporal changes that occur in chemical separation systems. Six fundamental aims will integrate property measurements and equation of state modeling (Aim 1), molecular simulations and design (Aim 2), advanced materials development (Aim 3), spectroscopy, scattering, and molecular interactions (Aim 4), process modeling and optimization (Aim 5), and design and implementation of lab-scale separation systems (Aim 6). Using proven experimental methods, the team will measure the thermophysical properties and vapor-liquid-equilibria required for designing an extractive distillation, absorption, or membrane process. High-throughput molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations will be used to calculate the solubility (phase equilibrium), selectivity, and transport properties of a large number of refrigerant-IL systems using molecular force fields validated by experiment. New ILs with fluorinated ions will be synthesized to explore the \\u201cchemical\\u201d space connecting refrigerants and ILs. The team will utilize a number of techniques to determine refrigerant-IL interactions including: pulse-gradient-spin-echo (PG-SE) NMR experiments for measuring self-diffusion, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments for studying intermolecular interactions, synchrotron X-ray scattering experiments for providing liquid structure factor S(Q), inverse Fourier sine transform for radial pair distribution function g(r), and quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) for dynamical specific length scales as examples.

There has been significant concern about the mental health of these youth, especially concerning the risk of adverse mental health events, including suicide. However, research shows that when nonconforming adolescents are well-supported, they have similar levels of depression to other adolescents. For such adolescents who seek medical intervention, these support systems may include parents as advocates and/or healthcare professionals who specialize in serving them. In these cases, decisions about steps towards intervention are made between the adolescents, their parents, as well as the physicians. Findings from this in-depth interview study will help inform healthcare professionals about ways in which medical services can improve for these adolescents. This research will also provide information for families and other stakeholders about how to advance the health and wellbeing of adolescents.  This project provides a platform for adolescents to describe their lived experiences, which can benefit the medical field and families that need their expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying gender non-conforming adolescents provides researchers with the opportunity to analyze the processes that contribute to the creation of their identities.  This project will explain how non-conforming adolescents who receive medical interventions address the complexity of their identities. Data collection involves 60 in-depth, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with three groups: 20 non-conforming adolescents, 20 parents of such adolescents, and 20 physicians who work with such adolescents.  Participants in this study will be identified through a combination of personal contacts and snowball sampling. Interview questions with physicians include exploring reasons for approving or denying medical services to adolescents, how they help facilitate discussions between parents and adolescents, and ways in which healthcare for these adolescents can be improved. Interviews with the parents focus on their child\\u2019s behaviors and interactions with doctors. Questions with the adolescents will probe for reasons behind their decisions to seek information about medical intervention and their experiences with this process. Interview data will be subjected to open coding to derive themes present in the data using NVIVO to manage transcripts and data analysis.

East Africa is the prime example of present-day continental rifting.  While a number of studies have yielded important insights in the older, more developed rifts in northern East Africa, there are major gaps in our knowledge of how rifting begins and develops due to sparse data in the younger Western and Southwestern rift systems.  In particular, there is significant uncertainty about how far ground deformation related to early-stage rifting extends across the region and to what extent deformation may occur without earthquakes.  This project will use a combination of ground deformation data from GNSS/GPS data, Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), and permanent seismometers to measure and investigate the kinematics of early-stage rifting across the Western and Southwestern rifts.  Results will improve our understanding of fundamental tectonic processes and earthquake hazard estimates in the region.

To achieve this goal, geodetic measurements, including campaign and continuous GNSS and InSAR, in this under-studied area will be increased.  This will provide improved constraints on the tectonic strain field across multiple temporal and spatial scales.

The modular construction of steel structures using castings reduces the structural weight, construction time, and erection costs. Steel castings also offer exceptional architectural freedom and high seismic and blast resistance. However, they are often large and geometrically complex, hence traditional mechanical testing is not commonly feasible, which prevents structural engineers from exploring their full potential. The outcome of this project will enable engineers to perform multiple tests on scaled-models using testing laboratories with limited capabilities instead of fewer tests on full-scale prototypes in sprawling facilities with expensive equipment, providing a better understanding of system-level behavior at a relatively meager cost. The research will also facilitate the development of design guidelines for structural steel castings, increase their market share, create new jobs in the US manufacturing sector, and reduce the carbon footprint.

The approach is centered on the additive manufacturing of reduced-scale models with the help of data-driven process and build parameters and post-heat treatments to satisfy geometric and material strength similitudes. It also comprises development of a deep neural network framework to be trained with large quantities of fracture data, numerically generated from realistic microstructures, to learn the damage scaling relationship that will relate the fatigue fracture behavior of additive manufactured models to full-scale steel castings. The experimental validation plan includes characterization of the microscopic fatigue damage using x-ray tomography and structural testing of two full-scale components.

The award also supports the NCCU Telescope Team in which students from the neutrino group contribute to local Outdoor Astronomy programs, and give lectures to high-school STEM programs and the public on the use of nuclear physics techniques for analysis of cultural artifacts. In addition, the PI will initiate activities with the Clement Early College High School students at NCCU to participate in the building and deploying of environmental monitoring instruments including radiation detectors.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The CEvNS interaction is one of the largest cross sections relevant to supernova dynamics and plays an important role in core collapse processes because the CEvNS cross-section is predicted, in the Standard Model, to scale approximately with the square of the target nucleus neutron number, N. This N-squared dependence is in fact the signature of the coherent nature of the interaction, indicating that the target nucleus recoils as a whole rather than as an individual neutron or proton. In order to fully probe the CEvNS interaction, a range of nuclei must be tested. This proposal enables NCCU to contribute to the deployment of a multi-ton NaI detector array and to develop a shielded array of low-background, low-threshold, p-type point contact Ge detectors.  In addition to the spectral N-squared dependence, the precision CEvNS measurements in Ge will lead to information on nuclear form factors. CEvNS measurement in the odd-proton nucleus 23-Sodium will hopefully be sensitive to axial vector contributions to the interaction. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The measurements of neutrino scattering cross sections are of interest to a broad range of physics communities. With a well-predicted Standard Model cross section, deviations from the expected values become a probe of non-standard neutrino interactions and may put limits on light mediator particles. The CEvNS interaction with solar and atmospheric neutrinos, for example, is an irreducible background to direct dark matter weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) searches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.223188877105713, \"y\": 8.26147747039795}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"NSFGEO-NERC:Collaborative Research: Chemistry and Biology under Low Flow Hydrologic Conditions Beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet Revealed through Naturally Emerging Subglacial Water\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"This project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation\\u2019s Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (UKRI/NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement.

This project seeks to understand the effect of large glaciers on weathering processes beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet and the consequences for life. During summer, nutrients and other products are flushed out of the Greenland Ice Sheet with water from melting ice. While these products have been sampled in spring and summer, it is not known how weathering processes are different during winter. In this project, researchers will sample the seasonal ice that forms in front of two of Greenland\\u2019s glacial outlets, Isunnguata Sermia and Leverett Glacier, during the freezing months to assess the chemistry and microbiology processes that reflect wintertime conditions beneath the ice sheet \\u2013 periods when input of fresh meltwater is minimal. These samples will increase knowledge of winter conditions under the Greenland Ice Sheet and help better understand the interior portions of the ice sheet which are largely inaccessible. Such information will help in assessing past conditions, when colder atmospheric conditions resulted in minimal meltwater input through the ice sheet and to the glacial bed. These analyses will inform understanding of the role of glaciers on earth\\u2019s nutrient cycles presently, under past ice age conditions, and in a future deglaciating world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greenland Ice Sheet is a major exporter of biologically important elements to the world\\u2019s oceans. However, most of our knowledge of chemical and biological fluxes from the ice sheet comes from the summer outflux of outlet glaciers whose channelized waters contact only a limited portion of the glacier bed. The majority of the glacier-bed interface contains slow-flowing, distributed waters not representative of this flux. The project will test the hypothesis that overwinter chemical and biological processes under outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet differ substantially from summer outflow and represent a window into widespread, but typically inaccessible, distributed flow. The principal sample collection method will be early spring coring of naled ice that forms at glacial termini from wintertime subglacial flow. Chemical, mineralogical, and biological constituents of this flow will be compared to material emerging from the initial, peak, and terminal phases of the melt season. Elsewhere in the Arctic, the chemistry of frozen overwinter subglacial material shows significant limitation in oxygen or sediment supply compared with even the first spring melt, supporting the idea that naled ice reveals a unique overwinter system. The naled ice and outflow of Isunnguata Sermia and Leverett Glacier will be sampled over two years. These West Greenland outlets differ by more than an order of magnitude in the size of the catchments they drain, thereby testing the effect of scale on biogeochemistry. Naled ice structure will be characterized by ground penetrating radar and ice borehole temperature profiles. The aqueous geochemistry, stable isotopes of carbonate and sulphate, and mineralogy of the suspended sediment of ice and water will be assessed. These analyses will document changes in the mineral flux and supply of atmospheric gases at the glacial bed between winter low flow conditions and peak summer melt. Microbial abundance, diversity, metagenomics, and stable isotopes of biomass will also be measured to understand the concomitant relationship between geochemical conditions and biological communities. Researchers will incorporate findings into a number of outreach efforts including developing a new curriculum module for the Center for Earth and Environmental Sciences, providing research opportunities for underrepresented students as part of the Bridge to Research Program and preparing hands-on activities for the Market Science Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.920408248901367, \"y\": 5.792815208435059}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Coherence Effects: A Sensitive Tool to Study the Few-Body Dynamics in Simple Atomic Systems\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"General audience abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the laws of Nature on a fundamental level is the most important prerequisite for technological development.  To this end, two major topics have to be addressed: a) a thorough understanding of the forces acting in Nature needs to be obtained.  It is well established that, on an elementary particle level, the mediation of these forces can only occur between two particles at a time.  This directly leads to the second topic: b) the description of the evolution of systems consisting of three or more particles under the influence of these pairwise acting forces.  This is known as the Few-Body Problem (FBP) in physics and it remains one of the most fundamentally important, and yet unsolved problems in physics.  The research supported by this grant aims to advance the understanding of the FBP by studying collision processes between ions and simple atoms or molecules.  Such collisions represent systems consisting of a relatively small particle number (typically 3 to 5 particles), which are nevertheless sufficiently complex to be strongly affected by the unsolved FBP.  This research will involve several graduate and undergraduate students and prepare them for the scientific and technological needs of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical audience abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the Few-Body Problem (FBP), the research team will perform kinematically complete experiments on several atomic fragmentation processes.  Their interest is focused on two aspects of the few-body dynamics: the importance of higher-order contributions and the role of projectile coherence effects.  Until recently, theory focused on perturbative methods in describing such processes.  In these models understanding the FBP means accurately describing the contributions of higher-order versus first-order contributions.  Their experiments are designed to sensitively test perturbative models and to determine the limitations of such approaches.  Regarding the second aspect, prior to recent work by this group and others, theory had assumed that the incoming projectiles are always fully coherent.  In studies over the last 8 years the researchers have demonstrated that for heavy particles this is not always a realistic assumption because of the particles' very small deBroglie wavelengths.  In the research supported by this grant the research team will use coherence effects as a sensitive tool to study interference effects in greater detail than was possible previously.  Interference structures, in turn, usually contain rich information on the few-body dynamics underlying the collision process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.606670379638672, \"y\": 8.785630226135254}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"RAPID: Scaling, causality, and modulation of the spread of COVID19\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Models of the spreading of the COVID-19 virus have yielded conflicting predictions for the value and time of the peak occurrence of cases. Most models tend to be one dimensional exponential growth, and thus do not account for spatial correlation. Other models are based on neural networks, which are capable of predicting if sufficient data are available, which is not at this instant of time the case for COVID-19. This study will use multifractals, which result from multiplicative processes with spatial correlations. Multifractals, due to their lack of a characteristic scale, may be ideal tools to analyze the spread of viruses, such as COVID-19; the spreading in a large city such as NYC could be similar to that occurring in a small city such as Newark, NJ. Multifractals have been used largely for geophysical data by various groups, and in some cases, to understand the spread of viruses, such as H1N5. This study will use data from the five boroughs of New York City and from Northern New Jersey (namely Bergen, Essex, and Union County). The team already has been collecting data from these communities in a project on community resilience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of this research is that multifractals can reflect both the scaling behavior and the exponential increase with time. Multifractals also account for the spatial correlation between subjects, and thus could be used to explain connectivity, be it at the individual level or at the level of cities (say NYC and Philadelphia). In addition, a look at the map of cases at the US (or the world scale) reveals spottiness, that is hot zones that are not uniformly distributed in space. The study team believes that the skeleton of the geometry is fractal (because of the lack of scale), and thus will be analyzing multifractals distributed spatially on a fractal network.

Most larvae are too small to find or track in the ocean, so we know little about how long larvae can survive and how fast they grow under natural conditions. This limits our ability to understand how marine species colonize remote habitats, or how much potential there is for long-distance gene exchange that can help populations adapt to changing conditions in the sea. Because larvae are so hard to follow, their movement is often estimated indirectly from transport models of ocean currents and analyses of shared genetic variation among populations.  These approaches are rarely combined, however, and the larval component of transport models is often based on unrealistic estimates of how long larvae can stay viable. This project is simultaneously generating estimates of larval dispersal from population genomic modeling and transport models of larval movement.  The larval movement models are grounded in data from larval rearing experiments that mimic the natural food and temperature conditions that larvae experience in the North Central Pacific. The combined approach is helping explain how marine species colonize and persist in very isolated island areas and how likely they are to exchange genes across vast oceanic distances. The project is providing interdisciplinary training for three graduate students and several undergraduate research assistants. In addition, the investigators are partnering with a science outreach coordinator to engage Hawaiian high school students in field and lab work.

Specifically, the investigators are integrating empirically-derived data on larval life histories, biophysical transport models, and population genetic inferences about gene flow to understand how patterns of dispersal and connectivity in marine systems are affected by the capacity of larvae of many species to prolong development and delay metamorphosis. They are measuring planktonic larval duration under environmentally relevant conditions to test the capacity of larvae to extend development in the dispersal pathways leading to and from the Hawaiian Islands. Results from these laboratory experiments, as well as water-column data gathered over the past two decades, will be used in larval transport models that incorporate estimates of temperature, food availability, and varying life-history traits. Population genomic data gathered from the same species in the field will assess the role of gene flow in shaping genomic structure between Hawai'i and other isolated archipelagos and islands in the region, identify larval dispersal pathways to and from Hawai'i, test contrasting historical models of gene flow, and estimate rates of larval dispersal in and out of Hawai'i.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Biological Oceanography Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 6.498281478881836, \"y\": 5.409473896026611}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Single-cell feedback, optogenetics, and deep learning to control gene expression in bacteria\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Heterogenous gene expression changes in bacterial communities are thought to produce subpopulations with particular survival benefits such as antibiotic tolerance.  Currently, scientists have few tools to mimic and study these gene expression events in a controlled manner.  The overall goal of this project is to develop light-based tools for precisely driving gene expression in targeted bacterial cells.  The tools have the potential to reveal how heterogenous changes in gene expression impact the survival of subpopulations of bacterial cells. In addition to these scientific advances, the research program is complemented by educational and outreach activities. These include partnering with the Tumble Science Podcast for Kids to create episodes targeted for young audiences (ages 6-12). The project also provides training opportunities for undergraduate students and includes additional outreach efforts related to K-12 science education.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal of this project is to develop methods to precisely drive gene expression in single cells, and to test these techniques in the context of bacterial stress response.  To achieve this, the researchers will use a high-throughput approach that uses automated microscopy, optogenetics, and microfluidics to implement real-time feedback control.  Cellular processes are noisy and nonlinear, and can involve delays and differential responses between genetically identical cells.  Thus, traditional control algorithms are either not accurate enough or too computationally expensive to be appropriate for large-scale analysis of gene regulatory network dynamics.  This proposal takes a new approach, taking advantage of emerging control algorithms based on deep learning models. The researchers will conduct high-throughput experiments where optogenetic light signals are applied to many single cells to generate datasets for training a deep learning model.  The deep learning model will then be used to implement feedback control in single cells using Deep Model Predictive Control to rapidly predict the optimal optogenetic stimulus to apply.  The ultimate utility of these tools is in their ability to precisely control genes within biological networks. To test this potential, the researchers will focus on the acid stress response network.

The monumental landscape presents an ideal case study for hunter-gatherer socio-political organization, and specifically the relationships between leadership, planning, mound building, and the Native histories that led to the remarkable Poverty Point phenomenon. The Jaketown site is a registered National Historic Place and learning more about the social organization of the extraordinary Poverty Point culture and the monuments they left behind will add to the already significant heritage value of the site.

Sometimes these changes take an element of a language's structure in an unexpected direction. Such is the case in the language examined in this study, where palatal approximant sounds, a speech sound similar to the \\\"y\\\" in English words such as \\\"you\\\" or \\\"yes\\\", has begun to be pronounced as the affricate \\\"j\\\" in the English word \\\"jeans\\\" or the fricative \\\"s\\\" in the English word \\\"closure\\\". This change is known as palatal approximant strengthening because the affricate and fricative sounds replacing the approximant require more articulatory effort and produce more acoustic energy in the speech signal. Most phonetic changes result in sounds characterized by less articulatory effort and less acoustic energy, and, thus, palatal approximant strengthening is an unexpected change. Studying a cross-linguistically rare type of phonetic change like palatal approximant strengthening offers a chance to gain deeper empirical insight into the physiological, social and linguistic forces that conspire to shape how individuals communicate and how languages change over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is guided by three research questions that are of descriptive and theoretical importance to the field of sociophonetics and its various applications (e.g. natural language processing, forensic science, etc.): 1) What is the acoustic profile of palatal approximant strengthening in particular languages where it occurs? 2) What are the linguistic factors that condition palatal approximant strengthening in particular and phonetic strengthening more generally? and 3) How does palatal approximant strengthening pattern in the social matrix of speaker groups comprising the speech community for the relevant languages?

This knowledge will benefit society as it will determine how disruption of these critical pathways may blunt adaptive behaviors, which have been found to be defective in human neurological conditions that include neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases.

The robustness theme considers data that contains errors or outliers, possibly due to an adversary, and will design methods for data analysis and prediction that are robust in the face of these errors. The theme on closed-loop data science tackles the issues of acquiring data in ways that reveal the information content of the data efficiently, using strategic and sequential policies that leverage information gathered already from past data. The theme on ethics and algorithms addresses issues of fairness and bias in machine learning, data privacy, and causality and interpretability.

By making concerted progress on these fundamental fronts, IFDS will lower several of the barriers to better understanding of data science methodology and to its improved effectiveness and wider relevance to application areas. Additionally, IFDS will organize and host activities that engage the data science community at all levels of seniority. Annual workshops will focus on the critical issues identified above and others that are sure to arise over the next five years. Comprehensive plans for outreach and education will draw on previous experience of the Phase I institutes and leverage institutional resources at the four sites. Collaborations with domain science researchers in academia, national laboratories, and industry, so important in illuminating issues in the fundamentals of data science, will continue through the many channels available to IFDS members, including those established in the TRIPODS+X program. Relationships with other institutes at each IFDS site will further extend the impact of IFDS on domain sciences and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 3.099595069885254, \"y\": 9.23163890838623}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative research: Quantifying Global and Regional Impacts of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) Slowdown in the 21st (twenty-first) Century\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"A denser liquid will sink below a lighter one just as vinegar sinks below oil in a salad dressing.  This sinking effect happens in the North Atlantic around Greenland and Iceland, where warm surface water brought by the Gulf Stream cools in the subarctic climate and becomes denser than the water below it.  The cold surface water sinks to great depth where it flows slowly southward, circulating throughout the world's oceans before resurfacing and returning to the North Atlantic. The resulting Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) moves surface water northward and deep water southward throughout the entire Atlantic basin.  The AMOC transports heat northward over its whole length, not just from the warmer tropics to the colder high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere but across the equator as well, transferring heat from the Southern Hemisphere into the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulations of the response of climate to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations consistently show a slowdown of the AMOC as climate warms, a consequence of warming-induced reductions in the density of surface water in the northern North Atlantic.  Density reduction is a direct consequence of warmer water temperature but reductions in saltiness also contribute, as fresh water (which is less dense) is added by melting ice sheets and increased precipitation. Also, the increased moisture content of warmer surface air reduces evaporation, and reduced evaporation means less salty surface water since evaporation removes fresh water leaving salt behind.  There is observational evidence for AMOC slowdown but the period of record is somewhat short for a definitive assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several climatic effects of AMOC slowdown have been claimed, including changes in precipitation over Europe, an increase in North Atlantic storms tracking into Europe, changes in the frequency and strength of El Nino events, and a southward shift in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the narrow rain band that typically sits north of the equator over the tropical oceans.  Many authors have argued that the AMOC slowdown is responsible for the North Atlantic Warming Hole (NAWH), a region of minimal warming or even slight cooling found in the North Atlantic south of Greenland in most climate change simulations.  A reduction in AMOC heat transport into the northern North Atlantic is a reasonable explanation for the warming hole, but it is possible to produce a NAWH in global warming simulations using a model that does not allow AMOC slowdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work supported through this award uses a novel methodology to examine the effects of AMOC slowdown and their connection to the NAWH using simulations from an ensemble of four climate models.  The simulations use a novel methodology in which just enough salt is removed from the surface ocean in the northern North Atlantic to prevent the AMOC slowdown that would otherwise occur due to greenhouse gas-induced warming.  A preliminary simulation performed with a version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) produces the NAWH as a consequence of AMOC slowdown, along with a reduction in rainfall over the warming hole and several other climatic impacts. But results from a single model are not definitive given that differences in model formulation can lead to substantial differences in model behavior.  The project also includes a detailed examination of the mechanisms through which AMOC slowdown causes local and remote responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has societal relevance due to the human impacts of climate change and the need to help decision makers confronting climate change.  The Principal Investigators conduct outreach activities at two museums, the Museum of Riverside and the Peabody Museum of Natural History, including public lectures and symposia as well as teacher development workshops.

In order to implement sustainable water resource policies, a thorough understanding of regional climate history is essential. The PIs will investigate previously undescribed terrestrial limestone rocks that form from spring activity (travertine) from Keane Wonder Spring (KWST), Death Valley, National Park to reconstruct the timing of past wet events. In addition to their potential as past recorders of the regions\\u2019 hydroclimate, travertine deposits serve to better understand how microbial communities that inhabit the spring water and associated sediment become part of the fossil record, thus informing the interpretation of the earliest records of life on Earth. Results from this research will help elucidate past changes in the regions\\u2019 hydroclimate and help inform our understanding of the pathways that govern microbial fossilization. This study will support three early to mid-career faculty, two graduate students and five undergraduate students at three institutions (two of which are minority-serving institutions). Training for students and class field trips will provide unique research opportunities for undergraduates including field surveys and lab processing methods. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Recent work summarizing global trends in travertine deposits indicates that peaks in deposition correspond with local times of high precipitation or wet conditions. Travertine deposits are common in Death Valley, but their reliability as hydroclimate archives has not been fully vetted across multiple climate transitions and necessitates comparison with well-calibrated, proximal hydroclimate records. In addition to their paleoclimate archive potential, travertine deposits are sensitive recorders of interactions between microbial communities and their environment, making travertine a target setting to assess the morphology and function of fossilized microorganisms. The PIs will use a suite of geochemical and microbiological analyses of modern spring water and associated modern travertine growth along distinct facies types of a spring flow transect to reveal the extent to which active travertine accretion records and preserves microbiological, geochemical, and hydrologic signatures. The PIs will analyze Quaternary travertine deposits at KWST and use a suite of geochemical and geochronological analyses to establish the timing of hydroclimatic changes in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\", \"x\": 7.509641647338867, \"y\": 6.013827800750732}, {\"AwardTitle\": \"Collaborative Research: Polar (NSF 19-601): RUI: Computational Polar ENgagement through GUided INquiry (Computational PENGUIN)\", \"AbstractNarration\": \"Researchers from the Northwest Research Associates Inc. and the University of Puget Sound will explore the pedagogical benefits of using computational guided inquiry (CGI) to integrate products of contemporary polar research into undergraduate courses. In CGI-structured learning, the instructor guides students in hands-on scientific inquiry using computational tools for analysis and visualization of data. The PIs propose to develop twelve, 2-3 week undergraduate teaching modules based on the analysis of polar data. The modules will be tested in a variety of undergraduate classrooms, including those at two- and four-year institutions. Students will gain computational skills working with Python programming and with critical thinking and analysis of polar data sets. The proposed work offers a range of broader impacts, including education of undergraduate students, development of new course materials, advancement of active learning methods, and engagement of undergraduate student researchers in polar and pedagogical research. Benefits to society include increasing climate and computational literacy and the understanding of polar regions and their role in the climate. The educational materials developed as part of this proposal will directly impact a variety of undergraduate courses at a range of institutions, including state universities, liberal arts colleges, and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is designed to test whether working directly with polar data via CGI can improve undergraduate climate literacy while enhancing learning outcomes in a variety of undergraduate courses. The work builds on proven educational practices: active learning and guided inquiry. Working with CGI-experienced instructors who will teach the modules, undergraduate researchers and an education research specialist, the PIs will refine the modules, guided by a constructivist framework that includes development of a mental model and hypothesis formulation and testing. An external evaluator will develop questions to measure student knowledge gains and deploy pre- and post-module knowledge surveys. Student survey results will be analyzed to assess knowledge gains and attitudinal shifts.

More broadly,  techniques that allow for reliable, mathematically grounded, inference and prediction from essential, but hidden,  signatures will be developed and applied to data sets arising from  neuroscience and high-throughput text data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A foundational study of inference and prediction from high-dimensional data with low-dimensional  embeddings modeled by factor models are undertaken in this project. Within new classes of  identifiable factor regression models in which the latent factors are interpretable, new scalable methods for estimating the regression coefficients of the latent factors  will be developed. Optimality of estimation from a finite-sample, minimax perspective, as well as the derivation of  the asymptotic limit of the estimates, and especially of their efficient asymptotic variance will be a cornerstone of research under this project.  Prediction from high-dimensional dependent features, with reduced-effective-rank covariance matrix, will be analyzed under generic factor regression models. In particular, interpolating predictors, popular in deep-learning,  will be contrasted with other contenders, with the aim of offering  fundamental understanding of model-free versus model-based prediction, when data arises from a factor regression model. Sparse topic models, together with inference and prediction from the hidden topics, will be studied as  companion models for data in which all the features are discrete.
